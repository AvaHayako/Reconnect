=========
This song was the result of a live production system, where I kind of just... did whatever I felt like. I thought there was the possibility I might make a song about the circumstances of the COVID-19 quarantine, but I wasn't quite certain until I was about halfway through writing the lyrics. I did, however, mention the possibility off-handedly at the beginning of the stream, but quickly dismissed it as unlikely, so think of that what you will.

This is also the first song I've been solely self-sufficient with the intended process since... I want to say my In Bloom EP. Not only did I write, record, mix, and master the song, but I also illustrated for it. The only thing I did not do myself was tune Luka for the VOCALOID version on the single; in fact, I hadn't initially planned for a VOCALOID version at all, but Circus asked if he could tune a cover and then did. So that's what happened.

Also replacing the usual just, blank end-card of my videos is an actual, proper outro. A few notes I wanted to leave because of the nature of it all:
---As an independent musician, I receive no backing beyond my Patreon, some Ko-fi donations, music sales / streams (please buy on Bandcamp for the most direct support!), and YouTube ads every once in a while. 
---I even opened up commissions recently, for the first time in a long time, trying to balance finances.
---COVID-19 is in fact, very devastating for creative workers, particularly because of the association of 'creative work' with 'luxury'.

As the result of all of the above, and as the sole proprietor of my music and media as a business, while it might sound annoying in the moment, I need all the help I can get. If you can't support me financially, via. Patreon or buying my music, please, please, PLEASE share this song and my music with your friends, family, and followers on social media. There's no amount of buzz that will not help me continue creating, and like I say in the video, a little goes a long way, a lot of a little makes a difference. Thank you for your support.

Dunno what to say in the comments? Tell me about how you're handling social distancing, or tell me what parts of the song you've sympathized with the most. Let's talk about it!

:-aqtKL6X6Zg,#StayHome and JAM #WithMe *New Music Video*  Imitation of Life,"Thank you so much for watching! HIT THAT SUBSCRIBE BUTTON AND THUMBS UP! :)
In a time when we find ourselves separated from each other, we wanted to bring our family and our friends together to help create the video for ""Imitation of Life"". 
Everyone received the song and we asked to simply lip sync or dance around but most importantly BE THEMSELVES!!! 
https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/billymick/imitation-of-life

You have to be reborn to truly be alive 
And like a Phoenix I will rise
And pick myself back up again
Had my share of heartache and of pain 
But I‚Äôve learned to dance in the rain
I am the best me that I‚Äôve ever been

Take the good with the bad
The happy the sad
Just be thankful for everything you‚Äôve had
The truth can cut like a knife
But anything less than truth is an Imitation of life
You gotta do more than just survive
And live while you‚Äôre alive
It‚Äôs up to you to make your dreams real 
Sometimes we‚Äôre up sometimes were down 
But the tears will only make you drown
You decide how you‚Äôre gonna feel
It‚Äôs okay I understand
Sometime things don‚Äôt go as planned 
Pick yourself back up and just stay strong 
Hurt can sometimes lead to a scar
But it makes us who we are
Just learn from it and roll along
Sometimes life throws you a curve
You just gotta learn to swerve
It‚Äôs what doesn‚Äôt kill us that makes us strong

AMAZING GRACE LYRICS

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home
And Grace will lead us home
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Was blind, but now I see

I N K A  G O L D

Oscar A Morales Vega - Flutes
Santiago Morales Vega - Guitar

Tired of Being Alone Lyrics:
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Won't you help me, girl,
Just as soon as you can.
People say that I've found a way,
To make you say,
That you love me.
But baby,
You didn't go for that,
Ha, it's a natural fact,
That I want to come back,
Show me where it's at, baby.
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Won't you help me, girl,
Soon as you can.
I guess you know that I, uh,
I love you so,
Even though,
You don't want me no more,
Hey, hey, hey, hey I'm cryin' tears,
Through the years,
I tell you like it is,
Honey, love me if you can.
Ya baby,
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby,
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night,
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby.
Sometimes I wonder,
If you love me like you say you do,
You see baby, I, I, I, I've been thinking about you,
I've been wanting to get next to you, baby,
Sometimes I hold my arms and I say,
Oh baby, yeah, needing you has proven to me,
To be my greatest dream, yeah
Awh!
I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby,
Baby, baby, ya ya, baby you're my heart's desire

:1Fvjvdegq0k,Home School Psychology - Optimism #withme #stayhome #togetherathome #alonetogether,"I‚Äôm gonna look at things on the bright side
It‚Äôs not gonna get me down it‚Äôll be all right
I‚Äôll be optimistic enjoying good times I don‚Äôt wanna miss it
It‚Äôs probably temporary most events pass
There are other things that I‚Äôm good at
I‚Äôm going to practice I can be a little better
Tell myself positive thoughts maybe even write myself a letter
Optimistic

In this video, Mr. Parker talks about why it‚Äôs so important to be optimistic. Being optimistic is looking at a challenge, looking for the best, and believing we will get through it and knowing it will get better. Most things are temporary, so even if you‚Äôre having a bad day it‚Äôs good to remember that tomorrow will be a new day. If you‚Äôre feeling down or having a tough challenge remember to be thankful for the great things in your life like your family and your friends. If you know that the future will get better it will help you be optimistic. Mr. Parker finishes up with a song to help us think of ways to be optimistic. 

Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you! 

Feel free to share these videos with anyone or any organization that might be able to use them, just give credit to Mr. Parker and a link back to this page.

#Cycling #WithMe #StayHome 

Not all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise. Discontinue your exercise session immediately if you experience any pain, dizziness or discomfort. 
Partaking in training sessions following GCN's video instruction is entirely at your own risk, and Global Cycling Network, its partners and its affiliated companies cannot be held responsible for any injuries which may occur as a result of these exercises.

So i hope James Charles sees this video of me trying to recreate his Instant Influencer look and approves of it!!

:1pwev5nP2TI,5 Continents ONE purpose bringing a message of hope during #Covid19 Pandemic,"5 Continents ONE purpose  

Gospel Artist Ps. Alma Rivera was very burdened for her city, New York, the epicenter of COVID-19 crisis in the USA and while in her living room one day, the Lord gave her awakening and eventually laid on her heart to proclaim the name of Jesus over her city, country and the world.

She decided to involve some friends who were producers, musicians, singers, pastors and worship leaders from 5 different continents to be a part of the song Your Name/Hear the Cry by Paul Baloche/Glenn Packiam/Darlene Zschech.


""The people who got involved in this project from all over the world. (Producers/ musicians/ Video,) did not get any compensation to do this. Everybody wanted to share their talents and be a blessing during this COVID19 pandemic."" Alma R.

For that, we decided to create a line of #DawnIntheLivingRoom clothing that can allow them to continue doing amazing projects like this. 

MORE Importantly, you can be a billboard display for hope.
with such phrases as

""I Will Live Forever""
""Faith Requires No Evidence""
""Be Strong""
and more.

Eastertime is traditionally all about new season lamb, spring greens, hot cross buns and, of course, Easter eggs.

The humble egg has been used by many cultures and religions throughout history as a symbol of new life and new beginnings. These days the Christian festival of Easter is when you're most likely to see them make an appearance.

Think about what is the right thing
Ask some questions quick like lightning 
You‚Äôve got to decide what to do because the best thing is the right thing
Do something to show what you know how to complete it correctly
Doing the right thing is always best


Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you! 

Feel free to share these videos with anyone or any organization that might be able to use them, just give credit to Mr. Parker and a link back to this page.

LYRICS
I woke up to the morning sky, first
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground
I shake leaves back down to the brown, brown, brown, brown
'Til I'm clean
Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees
By a meadow of green
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town, in style
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
It's a good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see
My favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers
They see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
Now take me to other side
Little bitty blues bird flies
And gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright
And we gon' (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh), yeah
It sound like (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh), yeah
The least I can say, I anticipate
A homecoming parade as we renegade
In the morning, right on
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
All my favorite colors, right
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
It's a good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers
They see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors

My Canned Chicken Fried Rice notes:
2 cups cooked white rice
3-4 eggs (whisked)
3 Tbls butter
1 can chicken (drained)
1¬Ω cups frozen vegetables 
2 Tbls mayo (to taste)
1 tsp garlic powder
3 Tbls soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
1 Tbls toasted sesame oil
salt to taste

Open and drain your cans. In a wok or large pan, add butter and saute chicken for 1 minute. Add frozen vegetables and seasonings and stir. Add your rice and saute until sauce is incorporated. Then make a hole to move the rice aside and add in your eggs. Scramble quickly and stir everything together. And done! Enjoy immediately with your family! Stay safe!

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

:4TpUnkAIsxY,A caffeine detox destroyed me || Test Dummy Ep. 3 || Popular Science (#stayhome and #learn #withme),"Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive drug on the planet. Like all good things in this world, it should be consumed in moderation‚Äîbut PopSci editors Jess Boddy and Claire Maldarelli were definitely not following that unwritten rule, guzzling between six and ten cups of coffee per day. That put them at risk for disrupted sleep, heart palpitations, unusual nervousness, and more. So they decided to detox. Will their torturous 14-day cut regulate their sleep patterns and teach them to respect caffeine for the powerful drug that it is? Find out on this week's episode of Test Dummy.

Hey BINGE Baes! It's your girl Blake Nichols, welcoming you to another new video. 

Since we're all staying home and keeping safe from COVID-19, I thought we (especially me) should workout.  If you don't like to workout alone, choose a virtual partner.

Just one tip, make sure your virtual partner ACTUALLY WORKS OUT WITH YOU! LOL

Hope you like this video!

Hi, there! I decided to participate in YouTube's #StayHome #WithMe campaign by making a video of my own. Right now, I'm really enjoying watching my favorite creators' videos and I know it's nice to have videos like this to keep you company. Today's video is a lot longer and more chatty than usual, so let me know if you like it more casual like this. I hope this video gives you chance to relax today and, if you do your nails while you watch, tag me on Instagram so I can see. Thanks for spending time with me! I hope you're safe, healthy, happy, and having a good day. ‚ù§Ô∏é

I‚Äôm going to try to be honest
Even when it‚Äôs hard to tell the truth
Like when I threw that ball and accidentally knocked out my brother's tooth
Cuz telling the truth feels a whole lot better than keeping it in
Lying never feels like a win
I want to build up all of my friendships I‚Äôd rather not risk it not being truthful in my life
I‚Äôm gonna be honest and tell the truth


Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you!

With a few simple items and a fair priced foot spa I put together my own little ‚Äúspa‚Äù at home. Let‚Äôs look at this as a blessing in disguise to get some much needed relaxation from the every day hussle and bussle. I am still working, this was after hours! I hope everyone is staying safe!

After seeing Eric Church in concert, he bought a guitar, moved to Nashville, and landed a publishing deal with River House Publishing. Fulcher has released several EPs and singles that have earned millions of streams across platforms, the latest being Somebody Like Me.

LYRICS
I‚Äôve got your number lonely October 33

I wear it on my soul‚Äôs back like fa fa fa

And I can hear the brass ring

I hear it in the nose bleeds

Where you once felt a cold breeze

Think it was Halloween

I‚Äôve got your number lonely October 33

That‚Äôs cold facts fa fa fa

Hold me down like you

know how darling

Hold me now like you know my plight

I do

Alone in the back

I‚Äôm sending love where you are at

I do

I‚Äôve got your number lonely October 33

Your love‚Äôs my only good thing like fa fa fa

So help me hear the bird‚Äôs sing

I‚Äôll help you capture your dream

Let us see the present and try to let be

I‚Äôve got your number lonely October 33

I‚Äôm knocking at your door babe like fa fa fa

And if you hear the band play

Then listen to my heart say

Its going to be a good day

I‚Äôve got your number

Crying in the back

I‚Äôm sending love where your at

I do

(solo/break)

Hold on

I‚Äôm going to make it alright stop and look and listen

with you

DIYHairpinLegs is offering their raw steel hairpin legs at cost + overhead (40% off).

In this episode of #StayHome #WithMe we are taking you behind the scenes of what it‚Äôs like to live in a 196 square foot Tiny House during quarantine.

Life has changed pretty drastically for many across the country and the world, but what about those that were already living a unique lifestyle? In this video we‚Äôre sharing our daily routines in our tiny house on wheels from waking up in our 9‚Äô x 7‚Äô x 3‚Äô sleeping loft, to having breakfast in one of the largest kitchen‚Äôs we‚Äôve ever had (even before living tiny) to so much more! 

You would think we‚Äôd have nothing to do in a home of this size during quarantine, but in fact, we‚Äôve been keeping busier than ever! So stay home and #CookWithMe #WorkoutWithMe #FilmWithMe and just #LiveTinyWithMe ! 

This is A Day in the Life in a 196 square foot Tiny House during Quarantine!

This was a fun wendys mukbang with me with The elliott family of 7. We bought burgers, fries and chicken sandwiches from wendys for the #mukbang / carbang. The elliott family of 7 loves doing mukbangs especially carbangs together. Wendys food is always hot and enjoyable. The french fries at wendys are some of my favorite for mukbangs. The Elliott Family of 7 hopes that you enjoy This #stayhome Wendys mukbang #withme.

I use a black marker to show the drawing better, but it will be easier to begin drawing with a pencil, so that you can correct it with an eraser. Then the drawing is ready, you outline it with a black marker.

***GIVEAWAY***
So, I will be gifting my 1000th Subscriber with an autographed apron, like the one I am wearing in the video. So, make sure you watch the entire video to hear the details.

This is my take on baking Amish Bread, what's the twist, you ask...Well, I used Grapeseed oil instead of butter or vegetable oil and of course, I added Flax Seed.

It turned out perfect...

Ingredients:
6 cups Unbleached Bread Flour
2 cups of warm water
1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
1/4 cup Grapeseed oil
1 1/2 tablespoon of Active Yeast
1 1/2 teaspoon of Salt
Flaxseed (enough to make the bread look pretty)
1 small egg (for egg wash)

Enjoy!","['Influencer', 'Naija', 'Naija-American', 'Forever Newlywed', 'Serving Realness all day everyday', 'All Tea Some Shade', 'Beauty', 'Lifestyle', 'Love', 'Vlog', 'Blog', 'Personal Vlog', 'Personal Blog', '#Smoon', '#Smooner', 'Nigeria', 'Nigerian-American', 'Real', 'Food', 'Foodie']",amish bread twist bakeinfluencer naija naija american forever newlywed serving realness day everyday tea shade beauty lifestyle love vlog blog personal vlog personal blog smoon smooner nigeria nigerian american real food foodiesmoon smooners amishbread giveaway gifting 1000th subscriber autographed apron like one wearing make sure entire hear detail take baking amish bread twist ask well used grapeseed oil instead butter vegetable oil course added flax seed turned perfect ingredient cup unbleached bread flour cup warm water cup granulated sugar cup grapeseed oil tablespoon active yeast teaspoon salt flaxseed enough make bread look pretty small egg egg wash enjoy,how-to,['guidance'],2188,[]

Eleanor Cummins, a freelance science and technology writer (and meditation app expert), joins in to answer Jess' questions and try sleep meditation for the first time using Calm. Meditating every day‚Äîon Headspace or Calm, for instance‚Äîis supposed to help Jess and Eleanor become more mindful, improve their sleep, lower their blood pressure, and ultimately de-stress them.

If you have a very hard passage from a concerto, break it down by first playing it slowly.  Then go over different dotted rhythms still in slow mode.  Then make up your own.  And if you can't think of other new rhythm patterns, turn to some Feuilliard where there are tons of rhythm exercises you can try out!  Let me know how it goes!  

Please show me your practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw. I will also be doing a live video everyday practicing each day‚Äôs focus on Instagram!

I use a black marker to show the drawing better, but it will be easier to begin drawing with a pencil, so that you can correct it with an eraser. Then the drawing is ready, you outline it with a black marker and then color it with colored pencils or oil pastel.

:8jZs6EEur3s,#StayHome And Travel #WithMe: Walk England's SW Coast Path!,"Finally a way to travel safely while I #StayHome!  Thanks to COVID-19, I've been going stir-crazy wishing I could resume travel. So, I did the next best thing: I hopped onto my treadmill and used Zoom's virtual background to bring you #WithMe on my hike along England's Southwest Coast Path.  My wife and I hiked this path in July 2019 from St. Ives to Penzance (sort of).

This video is admittedly a little rough, but I think you'll have fun watching it.

:8m1LFULxogA,Rose Dumplings Áé´Áë∞ÁÖéÈ•∫ | Lunchbox Recipes,"While we're staying at home, Felix is making Áé´Áë∞ÁÖéÈ•∫ (a.k.a. Rose Dumplings). This is our first try...How will it turn out?

We hope you enjoy this video. Please üëç the video & subscribe to our channel if you enjoy it. Kindly comment if you have any recommendations, questions, or just want to say hi!

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

DUMPLING SHELL:
‚ô° 500 grams flour
‚ô° 300 grams water
‚ô° food coloring (natural alternative: Blend the 300 grams of water above with beets and carrots for PINK, or with spinach for GREEN)

DUMPLING FILLING:
‚ô° 1 scallion/spring onion
‚ô° 1 to 1.5 lb ground pork
‚ô° sprinkle with salt & pepper (*we forgot this step...don't forget!)
‚ô° 1 egg (optional, for extra binding)
‚ô° 2 tablespoons cooking oil

CONDENSED INSTRUCTIONS:
‚ô° Divide the DUMPLING SHELL ingredients evenly in half.
‚ô° Mix each pile of ingredients with different colorings respectively.
‚ô° Knead the doughs until it has a consistency texture.
‚ô° Set aside two doughs to rest for 20 minutes.

‚ô° Combine DUMPLING FILLING ingredients. Mash until well mixed.

‚ô° Roll out dough into a long tubular shape and slice 4 pieces.
‚ô° Roll each of the 4 pieces into circles.
‚ô° Overlay the circles on top of each other by 50%.
‚ô° Spread the filling thinly on circles, lengthwise.
‚ô° Fold circles over the filling lengthwise.
‚ô° Gently add water to each end of the dough to make sticky.
‚ô° From one end of the dough, slowly roll all the way. You now made a rose!

‚ô° After making several rose dumplings, sear them on low heat for 2 minutes.
‚ô° Add water to the pan and cover the pan to entrap the steam. Steam this way for about 10 minutes.
‚ô° Take the dumplings out of the pan.
‚ô° Enjoy!

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

You guys probably already follow  my yoga channel
https://www.youtube.com/c/RangeofmotionwithAuroraWillows 

Thanks for your support there and I am really humbled to have you follow me here as well.
This is my break away time from being online and from my yoga work so I hope you enjoy my fun space.

I enjoy creating different things, right now I am playing with acrylic pouring but I do other things to.
I enjoy drawing, sewing, doing puzzles, clay work and recycling projects.
Sometimes I try new things as well.

About Joe:

Joe Wos has been a professional cartoonist since the age of 14. His career path over the past 30 years has taken as many twists and turns as one of his mazes, as he finds new and innovative ways to pursue his passion for the cartoon arts.

Some highlights include spending 30 years touring nationwide as a performer, illustrating stories live as he told them; founding and running a cartoon art museum in Pittsburgh; illustrating symphony performances live with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; and exhibiting his art in museums worldwide. Joe has also been the visiting resident cartoonist of the Charles M. Schulz Museum for the past 18 years.

Not all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise. Discontinue your exercise session immediately if you experience any pain, dizziness or discomfort. 
Partaking in training sessions following GCN's video instruction is entirely at your own risk, and Global Cycling Network, its partners and its affiliated companies cannot be held responsible for any injuries which may occur as a result of these exercises.

My flu symptoms were some of the worst I had experienced from pain which made me scream out in pain spreading throughout my body to being unable to breathe and coughing on top of it.

:BX0kRBN8ick,Cello Bow Control Exercises | Day 5 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"üß°Day 5 of Stay at Home Practice Challenge!  Today we are going to focus on some bow exercises.  Do you know of one that you can practice?  If not, you can check out this video where there are tons of ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlLvN-oNWwA&t=32s Doing bow exercises is a little bit like doing biceps curls at the gym.

A Get Ut All Done in Quarantine with 5 Kids is today's video! Being a mom of 5 there is always something to get done. Cooking, cleaning, feeding, and lots of organizing. In this video, I did some breakfast meal prep for my kids. Having already cooked breakfasts on hand helps them get up and get their day started.

ABOUT JILL CHOATE BASKETRY:
I'm Jill, I've been making basket for almost 30 years- welcome to my world of basketry! 

If you love weaving baskets and are looking for some good step-by-step instructional videos then this is the place to hang out.  I use to travel all over the country teaching basketry now I stay in North Idaho and make videos, it works.   

Watch my videos for easy to make and inspirational basketry projects.

My goal is to show you that weaving a basket is not rocket science and veering off into the unknown of designing your own baskets doesn‚Äôt have to be hard, it just takes a few tricks and a little bit of math.

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind!

Hey Banks fam!! I decided to do the BIG CHOP because I‚Äôm sick of my hair. I wanted to dye my hair back black because I miss my signature hair color. I cut off my hair because my eyelids kept blistering up due to me being allergic to hair dye. I am NOT a professional when it comes down to hair. This was all trial and error. Thank God it worked out perfectly for me. If you want to see how I style my new hair cut please subscribe and thumbs up this video so I can get right on that for you.

Potato Gnocchi is the most popular variety and if made properly it‚Äôs a treat to your palate. Today I am sharing with you a detailed video and key steps on how to make fluffy Potato Gnocchi with 9 tips. #playfulcooking #potatognocchi #pantrymeal

Freezing uncooked Gnocchi :

We always make it fresh and finish it right away. It tastes best when served fresh. If you have to store it, then layer it on a cookie sheet, dust flour on top, cover with clear wrap and place in the freezer. Once it‚Äôs frozen, then place it a zip pouch and keep in the freezer. 

You don‚Äôt need to thaw the frozen gnocchi before cooking. Just straight away drop in the hot water to boil.

1. Remember safety first when using/burning your candles and always make sure they are completely extinguished before walking away from them.  

2. Always trim your wick before and after each burn for a more favorable burning experience.

3. Never burn your candles to the end of the wick always toss after your wick becomes half an inch in size. 

4. Use a lid or dip the wick into the melted wax to extinguish the candle

5. Always place burning candles out of reach of children and pets when burning. 
Just a few tips to make your candle burning experience one that is happy.

I do the dishes (of course), clean my living room, straighten up a few things, scrub the bathtub, clean the toilet, and wipe down the bathroom sink! Who could use some extreme cleaning motivation right now? I love a good cleaning time lapse. Satisfying time lapses are everything haha. All month I've been telling myself: I need to clean the bathroom. Even though it just gets dirty again the next day ugh! I hope this motivates you to get up and clean something or organize something!

:FUzRf8hcTrE,Balcony Houseplant Tour | Spring 2020 #stayhome #withme,"Hi Friends! Welcome to my first ever, Spring 2020 Balcony Tour! 

This is also our first Premiere which means that there will be a live chat where you can ask me questions and comment on the video as we are watching it together! I hope to see you there!

Things are consistency are changing as I continue to learn what plants work best for my west balcony obstructed by a very leafy tree.  For the most part, plants that love full sun seem to love being out there so once the temperature is above 45 degrees, I move all my succulents and cacti out there so they can live their best life in full sun. I do have some plants that overwinter on the balcony but its more of an experiment and there has been some successes! I will be sharing some tips I have learned along the way in a separate video so subscribe if you to learn more! xx

:FqZmoyeVJY0,#StayHome & Bake #WithMe | Sugar-Free Banana Bread! | SOOO GOOD!!!,"Hey guys! Let's bake some banana bread! Today's instalment of #StayHome #WithMe features my scrumptious yet healthy banana bread made with oat flour and a medley of other healthy and very accessible ingredients. I hope you give it a try and that you love it as much as I do! 

I also show you how to make your own oat flour so if that's something that interests you then, you're welcome. 

Sorry about the poor lighting. I really need to invest in some money but well all in God's timing. 

Please like this video so I know you enjoyed it and so that I'll know to make similar videos in the future. Also, please leave a comment letting me know your thoughts on my recipe and if you're going to try it. Subscribe and join the #NezzleFam!

Here's the recipe if you want to try it with me:
This recipe is for 1 loaf of banana bread. In the video I show you for 3 loaves. However, I think persons are more likely to try one at a time. Also, this way you can easily multiply it based on the number of loaves you want to make.

Ingredients
* 3 bananas, mashed (the ripe, spotty ones)
* 1 3/4 cups oat flour
* 3/4 cup cooking oil 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 2 ounces raisins (1/2 cup)
* 1 tablespoon vanilla essence (1 teaspoon vanilla extract)
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon 
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 
* 2 eggs (or chia eggs or flax eggs)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda 
* 1/2 tablespoon chia seeds (if chia egg not used)
* 1/2 tablespoon hemp seeds

Instructions
* Preheat oven to 180 C
* Beat eggs in a mixing bowl
* Add the bananas, vanilla essence/extract and oil. Continue to mix until the ingredients are well blended. Set aside.
* In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and raisins. Mix well.
* Gradually add the flour mixture to the banana mixture. Continue to fold until all the ingredients are well incorporated.
* Grease a loaf pan (or use a cooking spray like I did) and then pour the mixture on it.
* Bake for 50 minutes or until it passes the toothpick test
* Remove from the oven and let it cool down. 
* Slice your banana bread and enjoy!
* Share with others or have it all yourself (I won't judge lol)

Sing with your children and feel the warm sensation of precious families.


Lyrics

I love my relatives, happy family.

Ronda's Leftover Fried Rice: 

Use leftover meat from Travis‚Äô ginger chicken recipe, or whatever you like!

3lbs chicken
2 cups long-grain white rice
4 green onions
1/2 a head of cabbage
2 large eggs
Kimchi
Pickled onions
Soy sauce

Throw the green onions and cabbage in a pan with avocado oil and cover it.

Wisk your 2 eggs. Add a little bit of tonic water if you want them extra fluffy 

Turn the heat off on your green onions and cabbage but leave them covered. 

Now cook your eggs. You can add these in at the very end to everything since eggs cook so quickly, or go ahead and cook them in a separate pan to get them out of the way.

Turn the heat back on for your veggies. Throw the rice in with your green onions and cabbage and fold everything together. 

Cut up your chicken into smaller to medium-sized cubes and add that to your veggies and rice in your pan or wok. 

After everything is incorporated, you can add some random things or whatever you like. 

Ronda added 2 tablespoons of kimchi and 1 tablespoon of pickled onions along with some of the pickling brine. 

If you want to make it saucy, sauce it up! Ronda dropped in a capful of soy sauce at the end before bowling it up.

This is a recipe perfect for expression and for whatever you have in your kitchen. Use any protein, any mix-in. Make it your own and have fun!

Does it always turn out perfect? No.. But i LOVE experimenting in the kitchen! I get made fun of sometimes for ""cooking"" for my husband, and taking care of my home, but people dont realize that it's something i 100% LOVE to do! (also, i think people are crazy for thinking the way they do.. lol) I love cooking, i love eating, and i love cleaning. I cant help it if you dont understand that.. But anyway i hope yall enjoy these recipes i am sharing with you! This past week i just decided to cut the camera on and film whatever i was making. Let me know if you like these kind of videos because i dont mind making them. I enjoy it completely. Thanks so much for watching and thanks for your support.

:H1gBmLMyahQ,Ronda's Quarantine Kitchen: How To Make Jerky #StayHome #WithMe,"Ronda continues her quarantine by making jerky out of venison hubby Travis Browne hunted last season. With the help of an air fryer and Blurry Jessie, everything turns out delicious. 

Learn how simple and fun jerky-making can be in Ronda's Kitchen with the following ingredients: 

Ronda and Blurry Jessie used a venison roast with three different marinade seasonings:

Recipe no. 1: Low sodium jerky:

Made simply by marinating the venison in teriyaki sauce for 8-24 hours (depending on flavor level you'd like).

Recipe no. 2: Salt and pepper teriyaki jerky:

Marinate the teriyaki jerky then add crushed black pepper and sea salt to taste.

Recipe no. 3: Everything jerky:

Use the teriyaki jerky as a base then add crushed black pepper, sea salt, onion powder and garlic powder to taste. 

Using a Ninja Foodie, we used the dehydrate setting and had the venison drying for 3 hours at 165. Everyone's dehydrator will be different! Time and temperature will vary by your brand of dehydrator. 

Enjoy and stay safe, Rowdy Ones!

:H60uwsY1xng,A NATURAL TEA TO BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM. #stayhome and Cook #withme,"This tea is made with natural ingredients ; Ginger, Garlic, Lemon and Honey. Each of these ingredients has it's unique, yet exceptional benefits to the general human body mechanism.
 
HEALTH BENEFITS OF GINGER 
The Active Ingredient in Ginger Can Help Fight Infections
Gingerol, the bioactive substance in fresh ginger, can help lower the risk of infections.
In fact, ginger extract can inhibit the growth of many different types of bacteria (29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).
It is very effective against the oral bacteria linked to inflammatory diseases in the gums, such as gingivitis and periodontitis (31Trusted Source).
Fresh ginger may also be effective against the RSV virus, a common cause of respiratory infections (32Trusted Source).https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger

HEALTH BENEFITS OF GARLIC 
Garlic Can Combat Sickness, Including the Common Cold
Garlic supplements are known to boost the function of the immune system.
One large, 12-week study found that a daily garlic supplement reduced the number of colds by 63% compared to a placebo (6Trusted Source).
The average length of cold symptoms was also reduced by 70%, from 5 days in the placebo group to just 1.5 days in the garlic group.
Another study found that a high dose of aged garlic extract (2.56 grams per day) reduced the number of days sick with cold or flu by 61% (7Trusted Source).
However, one review concluded that the evidence is insufficient and more research is needed (8Trusted Source).
Despite the lack of strong evidence, adding garlic to your diet may be worth trying if you often get colds.

HEALTH BENEFITS OF LEMON 
Lemons contain a high amount of vitamin C, soluble fiber, and plant compounds that give them a number of health benefits.
https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/benefits-of-lemon-water

HEALTH BENEFITS OF HONEY 
Honey Can Help Suppress Coughs in Children
Coughing is a common problem for children with upper respiratory infections.
These infections can affect sleep and quality of life for both children and parents.
However, mainstream medications for cough are not always effective and can have side effects. Interestingly, honey may be a better choice, and evidence indicates it is very effective (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).
One study found that honey worked better than two common cough medications (30Trusted Source).
Another study found that it reduced cough symptoms and improved sleep more than cough medication (29Trusted Source).
Nevertheless, honey should never be given to children under one year of age due to the risk for botulism (31

:H7aEoQ0aqaA,Fruits that Burn Fat Like Crazy (#StayHome and improve your knowledge #WithMe),"Losing weight is not easy. Our bodies evolved to store fat to protect against periods of famine, but since millions of us are now eating way more than our bodies need, we end up with too much fat. To lose it, you need to trick your body into thinking you really are starving by taking in fewer calories than you burn.

Luckily, beyond calorie restriction, there are a few things you can do to jumpstart and extend your weight loss in a healthy way. Fruits that contain the antioxidant anthocyanin (a flavonoid) have been shown in multiple studies to increase the effects of a weight loss diet. You can usually spot an anthocyanin-rich fruit because it will be some shade of red or purple. Here are 7 great ones to add to your daily meal plan.

Khloe Kardashian REACTS to rumors she's pregnant with her second child! - https://youtu.be/sSgO8vdcFAY

Jake Paul has been a huge YouTube star for years now with an audience of primarily pre-teens. His pranks and extreme energy in videos always catered to a younger audience, but it seems that he‚Äôs trying to buck his Disney image. He decided in 2020 to go from PG to Rated R in his recent videos. Now, to no one‚Äôs surprise, these videos were taken down by YouTube. But Jake decided that was no good and put them back up. Now people are starting to call Jake out on this sudden switch.

THE VIDEO CALL IN SHOW:
A different kind of interaction with audiences. The Video Call In Show invites YOU to video (or audio) conference in to be a LIVE guest on the show! This results in Instant collaboration, we're dedicated to giving others a platform to talk about what ever topic or promotion they are passionate about, and give them the opportunity to reach audiences they normally would not.

üî• Would you like to participate or collaborate, on or off-line? Drop a comment on any of our videos and let us know!
Our live call in show invites viewers to participate via video or audio, phone call in, and chat. We've created a live video podcast format that we livestream as a live call-in show. Hilarious, funny call-in show fails, call-in show trolls and call-in show pranks are practically impossible - instead, we encourage live audience participation, live interviews, instant video collaboration and pure video chat interaction fun. 

We will talk to, and live interview any good person. Use as your vice video call in showtime to promote your YouTube channel and YouTube videos to help grow your channel, to promote your corporate brand, products/services, your business website or your personal website. By calling in to our show callers have the opportunity to engage with your audience, tell your story and promote those interests that are important to you.

Call the livestream at showtime (as you might for radio call-in show), via the easy and free Zoom teleconferencing app and/or website. Enjoy the birth of the video teleconference call-in show revolution and live video engagement. Let's have some fun doing it!

:ImWVQUmsb64,Set Quarantine Goals #stayhome and #setgoals #withme,"Have a drink with me in my basement and I‚Äôll tell you how to make the most of this coronavirus lockdown period.

Will you emerge from this time of physical distancing feeling like it was a life interruption? Or will you emerge feeling accomplished, and ahead of the game?

During week one of social distancing, I spent way too much time scrolling through social media and reading coronavirus news. This left me feeling depressed and unproductive. 

So this week, I decided that I will instead use this time to accomplish some short term goals, so that I emerge from this situation with a sense of accomplishment and can look back on it as a pivotal moment in my life, instead of looking back on it with resentment.

I decided to set quarantine goals around the SIMPLE¬Æ methodology that I introduced in one of my earlier YouTube videos: https://youtu.be/UQhxX_YN4nU

In a nutshell, this mental framework enables me to experience more life satisfaction by constantly monitoring and calibrating my levels in these six ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù of life:

Spirituality
Intellect
Money
Physicality
Love/relationships
Entertainment

These levels are in constant flux. If any area is miscalibrated, I feel off my game at best, severely depressed at worst.

So with that framework in mind, my personal quarantine goals are as follows (note: the tricky thing about setting these goals is that we don‚Äôt know how long this will last):

Spirituality: Meditate/pray for 20 minutes, twice per day. I start with writing in my gratitude journal, followed by affirmations, then meditation. I go into the full routine in this video: https://youtu.be/tbM8xtwQ1xw

Intellect: Complete a new online course. Finish writing the first draft of my new book.

Money: Our business revenue is way down due to this crisis. I will use this time to clean up my books, file my taxes early, and curate products and services that don‚Äôt perform as well.

Physicality: My goal is to lose 6 pounds of body fat. Although gyms are closed, I work out indoors, and will continue to run outdoors as long as the law permits. I‚Äôm training for my 12th consecutive Peachtree Road Race, which happens on July 4th. I‚Äôm praying this is all over by then.

Love/relationships: (Re)connect with family and friends. I‚Äôm already doing this through social Zoom calls, virtual game nights, and just calling and chatting with people way more than I ever used to... because just a week ago, we were all ‚Äútoo busy.‚Äù

Entertainment: Yes, I am binge watching some shows. Currently I‚Äôm catching up on Snowfall and Billions. I‚Äôm pushing this activity toward the end of my day, because it helps me fall asleep quicker when my mind isn‚Äôt consumed with real life stressors. I‚Äôm mindful of bingeing too much though, because it is a quadrant 4 activity (I explain here: https://youtu.be/TlQgCmR3Wjk ).

Yes, I plan to do all of the above all while we home school two kids, and fight to keep our businesses afloat. Why? Because even if I never get coronavirus, it is still trying to defeat me mentally, spiritually, physically, and financially. I won‚Äôt let it.

What quarantine #goals are you setting?

:Inj5lDn_kFc,How to Pizzicato | Day 15 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"üß°Day 15 Stay at Home Practice Challengeüëáüèº

Today is all about Pizzicato!  Of course in saying the word pizzicato, I can't help but to think about the Italian people.  I am from New York City so I can only commiserate what they have been through.  Anyway, today not only are we going to learn how to pizzicato to produce the best sound, and also to learn to use it as a tool to practice difficult passages.  Have you used pizzicato for your practice before?

Please show me your practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw. I will also be doing a live video everyday practicing each day‚Äôs focus on Instagram!

:JoAYeG8hZ2w,#StayHome and Learn Beginner Chinese #WithMe | Chinese Phrase of the Day Challenge (WEEK 14/DAY 2),"We‚Äôll take a close look at the Chinese words ËßÅÈù¢ (ji√†n mi√†n) and ËÅäÂ§© (li√°o tiƒÅn) in today‚Äôs video. ËßÅÈù¢ (ji√†n mi√†n) is actually a common type of Chinese verbs: the ‚Äòverb-object‚Äô verbs. Once Wei Wei explains how ‚Äòverb-object‚Äô verbs work, you‚Äôll feel totally clear about an aspect of Mandarin grammar that confuses a lot of students. üòäüí°

We actually have a GREAT example of a native speaker using ËßÅÈù¢ (ji√†n mi√†n) in an unscripted conversation in Unit 4 of our Upper Intermediate Conversational Course - with a lecture breakdown of the dialogue. Learn more about the course here: https://bit.ly/2yMp1JZ

About Me:

Hi! Welcome to my kitchen! Cooking has always been one of my hobbies and passions! I have a sickness for cooking something over and over again until I get it perfected down to the ¬º tsp! 

I‚Äôm a wife, mother of 2, and own a zoo‚Ä¶lol, not really but close! I live on a ranch in Texas so most of my cooking has a Southern flair. Before I met my husband, meat was not a regular on my menu but after I got married boy did that change! 

I‚Äôm so excited to share my tried and true recipes, tips and tricks, and view into my everyday life with you! So come on in, pull up a seat, and sit a spell in my Ranch Style Kitchen!

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

:MdkTZpGeYzs,Client Cries Over Big Chop|  #stayhome #withme,"In this video, I did a #bigchop on my gorgeous client. I didnt let her see her results until the end of the video. The main reason for her Big Chop was to transition back to healthy hair, she had been using texturizer around the edges of her hair since a child to make it more manageable. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take that all off, so I did decided to give her some baby hair. SHE WAS DEF READY FOR HER #BIGCHOP but seeing so much hair come off can be overwhelming. I wasn't sure if her tears were for excitement or sadness, but her mom sent me a text confirming a few days later that she loooveeddd her cut! Im so excited for her I think the journey is so liberating and such a confidence booster, and I can't wait to see her THRIVE! Thanks so much for watching.

Lyrics:
I was living a lie, living a lie
This is my confession
I was living a lie before we met
There were so many nights, so many nights
Full of dark temptation
There were so many nights that I regret

You give me something that I can hold onto
A little light when I'm down on my knees
I was so lost in myself when I found you
But in that moment you made me believe

You give me freedom, freedom
Freedom I've been looking for
Freedom, freedom is you
You give me freedom, freedom
Freedom I've been looking for
Freedom, freedom is you

You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for
You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for

You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for
You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for

I didn't care
I didn't care enough to stop me falling
I didn't care about myself
Till you lifted me up
Lifted me up when I was down and out
It's the highest I have ever felt

You give me something that I can hold onto
A little light when I'm down on my knees
I was so lost in myself when I found you
But in that moment you made me believe

You give me freedom, freedom
Freedom I've been looking for
Freedom, freedom is you
You give me freedom, freedom
Freedom I've been looking for
Freedom, freedom is you

You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for
You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for

You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for
You give me freedom-dom
Freedom, freedom
You give me freedom-dom
I've been looking for

You give me freedom, freedom
Freedom I've been looking for
Freedom, freedom is you

:NqoEtKK-Fjo,#StayHome [CODE] #WithMe - JavaScript Quarantine Coding Project Ideas,"In this video you get to stay at home and code with me! But I won't be at my house. I'm crashing the houses of @Dev Ed, @DesignCourse, @Web Dev Simplified, and @Traversy Media. They won't be on screen since we have to practice social distancing and stay at least 6 feet away from each other.

All jokes aside, I hope that this gives you something to do and keeps your mind going during these rough times. Staying quarantined is not fun but we can use this time to our advantage.

The best way to get good at coding is to code, code, and code some more. Find a project to code on your own. We are going to create some stuff today with JavaScript and I'm going to send you off with some homework.

Use the resources below to get a project idea of something to code. I want you to create a pen on codepen.io and code it. Then, tweet the pen on twitter, tag @codeSTACKr, and include the #CodeWithMe. I'll pick a few and feature them in a future video. Or maybe I'll live stream a code review.. What do you think? I've been thinking about live streaming, I've just never done it before.

:OUK3F9bM6D4,#StayHome w/ Lilly Hiatt | BMI's Jam Sessions,"Lilly Hiatt knows how to grapple with tough times: she picks up a guitar. The East Nashville singer/songwriter blends countrified rock with emotionally challenging lyrics on her latest (and fourth) album, Walking Proof. The 2020 LP earned praise from Rolling Stone as being the ""most cohesive and declarative statement"" of her career, and it features contributions from Nashville veterans like Amanda Shires, Aaron Lee Tasjan, and even her own father, John Hiatt. As Hiatt's official bio mentions, she doesn't feel as lost as she once did, and her new music is a roadmap that she's created for all of us.


BMI's Jam Sessions features two- to three-song sets by some of our most talented songwriters and composers. By sharing recordings from their homes or meaningful locations, these songwriters are making this series all the more personal and exciting for fans.

The pandemic of COVID-19 really hit us hard in mid March.  After debuting at the Mountain View Spring Bluegrass Festival, one concert after another on our Louisiana tour was canceled.  In the middle of all the uncertainty, David Stewart and Mark ‚ÄúBrink‚Äù Brinkman, reached out to us with a brand new song, ‚ÄúLove is the Key‚Äù.  As soon as we heard it, we immediately jumped in with both feet to arrange it and release a performance video on Facebook.  In less than 48 hours, the song hit over 50K views!  The video gained even more traction when Bluegrass Life, the world‚Äôs largest network for bluegrass, shared it on their own Facebook page, reaching 100K views and still climbing.  Almost immediately after posting, we received several messages from fans wondering if we had a copy of the song to buy and if not, when would we.  A week after the song was pitched to us we were able to record in studio with our producer, Ben Isaacs, of @The Isaacs.  We knew we wanted this song to reach as many people as possible, so we reached out to Sammy Passamano III, with @The 615 Hideaway Entertainment to help us with radio promotion.  We are excited to share the message of this song to the world! 

""Fear so often locks us in.  It blurs our vision and ultimately keeps us from all we were meant to be.  This song talks about the key to release us from fear‚Äîlove.  Love alone is the answer.  We want this song to be a ray of hope in these dark and scary times.  We want you to be free, free from the lies, free from fear."" ‚Äì The Family Sowell  

LYRICS:
This world is filled with trouble‚Ä¶hearts are full of hate
The walls are closing in‚Ä¶there seems like no escape
But, love‚Äôs the greatest gift‚Ä¶God gave to you and me
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

If the Devil‚Äôs finds your shoulder‚Ä¶he‚Äôll whisper in your ear
Telling lies about tomorrow‚Ä¶filling you with fear
You can stand up to Satan when you‚Äôre down on your knees
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key
Call on His name‚Ä¶He‚Äôll set your spirit free
Jesus cut the master key that day on Calvary
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre rich‚Ä¶you‚Äôre hungry or you‚Äôre poor
We are all the same‚Ä¶when despair is at the door
There‚Äôs nothing on this earth‚Ä¶God‚Äôs love can‚Äôt defeat
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key
Call on His name‚Ä¶He‚Äôll set your spirit free
Jesus cut the master key that day on Calvary
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

Jesus cut the master key that day on Calvary
Fear is the lock‚Ä¶love is the key.

‚ÄúLove is the Key‚Äù

Lyrics:
Stuck inside this quarantine
I feel myself going crazy
Dont know who to bother next
My mama or maybe frankie
Big fuck you to this corona whore
2020s most hated
Stuck inside this quarantine 
I feel myself going crazy

Fuck 
You
Corona and what you do
I got big
Plans
And neither of them
Involve you nor your friends
So please clap your hands
To the beat of this song
Shakin‚Äô what ur mama gave u
that aint ever wrong
I said please clap your hands
Middle finger in the front
F u corona virus
Sippin wine 
Rollin our blunts

Stuck inside this quarantine
I feel myself going crazy
Dont know who to bother next
My mama or maybe frankie
Big fuck you to this corona whore
2020s most hated
Stuck inside this quarantine 
I feel myself going crazy

Trying to pass the time
Without losing my mind

(Im sorry)
This isnt very prudent
Its rude and what you doing
I just want to go to school
And well no
I dont
But you werent invited
And this friendships unrequited
You not welcome in the slightest
No not
At all
So please leave
Let the people be free
Do not come near me
You have been blocked (im sorry)
Quarantining
To give you this beating
Groove is too appealing
Got corona begging us to stop

Stuck inside this quarantine
I feel myself going crazy
Dont know who to bother next
My mama or maybe frankie
Big fuck you to this corona whore
2020s most hated
Stuck inside this quarantine 
I feel myself going crazy

Trying to pass the time
Without losing my mind","['#MonicaRiskey', '#RiskeySpinsTheDiskey', '#MonRiskey', '#StayHome', '#Quarantine', '#Corona', '#FuckYouCorona', '#FUCorona', '#COVID-19', '#StayAtHomeChallenge', '#BedroomPop', '#IndiePop', '#Pop', '#InUhBreeze', '#Glossier', '#Skywash', '#GusDappertone', '#MollyPayton', '#Clairo', '#Grady', '#Beabadoobe', '#GirlInRed', '#OriontheSun', '#StupidRichKid', '#Brooklyn', '#NewYorkTough', '#RittMomney', '#Huck', '#ZackVillere', '#ChristianFrench', '#ChelseaCutler', '#JeremyZucker', '#OmarApollo', '#SophieMeiers', '#Col3trane', '#COVIDRelief', '#NewMusic', '#BestNewArtist', '#Producer', '#Songwriter', '#Binghamton']",monica riskey fu officialmonicariskey riskeyspinsthediskey monriskey fuckyoucorona fucorona stayathomechallenge bedroompop indiepop pop inuhbreeze glossier skywash gusdappertone mollypayton clairo grady beabadoobe girlinred orionthesun stupidrichkid brooklyn newyorktough rittmomney huck zackvillere christianfrench chelseacutler jeremyzucker omarapollo sophiemeiers col3trane covidrelief newmusic bestnewartist producer songwriter binghamtonnew song fu listen orcd co monicariskey fu turn notification stay updated new uploads monica monicariskey open artist 3jphmpv3qod4qrz7jfkw7w si diuhrx2usuigcmofworjtq monicariskey tik tok monicariskey monicariskey ucuzq_jmmnl1qhuxtrk5pmxq lyric stuck inside feel going crazy dont know bother next mama maybe frankie big fuck whore 2020s hated stuck inside feel going crazy fuck got big plan neither involve friend clap hand beat song shakin ur mama gave aint ever wrong said clap hand middle finger front virus sippin wine rollin blunts stuck inside feel going crazy dont know bother next mama maybe frankie big fuck whore 2020s hated stuck inside feel going crazy trying pas time without losing mind im sorry isnt prudent rude want go school well dont werent invited friendship unrequited welcome slightest leave let people free come near blocked im sorry quarantining give beating groove appealing got begging u stop stuck inside feel going crazy dont know bother next mama maybe frankie big fuck whore 2020s hated stuck inside feel going crazy trying pas time without losing mind,artistic,"['integration', 'reassurance']",192,[]

:PIF2OLY-B74,How To Make Ghetto Salad! #stayhome #withme,"#Cookwithme #stayhome #withme #Cooking #Quarantine #Broke #Howto

Welcome Back! Today On My Broke A** Kitchen we are making Ghetto Salad!
Why is it called Ghetto Salad you may ask? One day I bartered my kettle corn for onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh pulled mozzarella. Out of ideas on what to do with all that food I was just gonna chop it and mix it all with salad dressing. The only problem was I was out of salad dressing. I whipped up some half ass ceasar dressing and I said ""Damn that shit is ghetto."" Ghetto Salad was created and is constantly evolving. 
Enjoy!

:PRao6lVmsoQ,ASIAN AMERICANS ON THE CORONAVIRUS #stayhome,"Share with a friend & let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

TAKEAWAYS:
1) Cherish this time with your parents because when you‚Äôre young - all you want to do is get away.  But when you‚Äôre older, all you want to do is be there at a time like this.

2) A lot of businesses got affected by this and a lot of jobs were lost.  All restaurants are takeout only, and some just closed completely and some closed permanently. A lot of people can‚Äôt go to work and make money

3) Harassment, violence and targeting of Asians is completely unwarranted, undeserving.

4) This is a really significant event that is probably going to change a lot of how we move as a country.

:PVIiNLCBMcI,Trying to figure out the new normal...in my slippers // #stayhome #withme,"KYRGIES LINK: http://kyrgies.com/discount/HALLEASE

Like most of you, I'm trying to find a normal in these uncertain times that we are all collectively in together. It's been really interesting to see how much the internet has allowed me to continue to connect with my friends, colleagues, my parents.

Through all of the frustration though, I do genuinely believe this is a transformative time that we‚Äôre in.  I‚Äôm a glass half full kind of person and I have to have faith that we‚Äôll come out of the other end of this stronger. Definitely scathed, but stronger nonetheless. 

I feel like we‚Äôre all collectively realizing how connected we truly are, not just within our local communities but globally as well. 

I‚Äôm generally pretty introverted and even I‚Äôm starting to feel a little off kilter with the distancing.  Afterall, we are social creatures and so because of that I‚Äôm grateful that you all are spending time with me here. Likewise, I hope this video helps you not to be too lonely ‚Äì wherever you are in the world. #vlogumentary #Kyrgies

:Pc0uA4VCJ0Q,Home School Psychology - Asking For Help #stayhome #withme,"Lyrics 
Asking for help isn‚Äôt that hard if you just use all the skills that you know
Think about the problem get somebody‚Äôs attention you can be awesome by asking a question
Smile and thank them for their guidance getting the advice is better than silence


Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you!

#StayHome #WithMe #StopCOVID #LockdownStrategy #BestPreventionsToSaveYourself #CoronavirusEffectsCountry #Howtostopcoronavirus

You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you: Do
1. Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
2. Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze.
3. Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
4. Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell. 

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

Can someone spread the virus without being sick? People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).

Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

How easily the virus spreads

How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (‚Äúcommunity spread‚Äù) in some affected geographic areas.

‚ÄúThe Isolation Blues‚Äù
By Bob Baker (c) 2020

Lost count of the hours, lost count of the days
Not been outside, or seen the sun's rays
During this crisis, I‚Äôm staying at home
Trying to get used to being all alone
I know it could be worse
At least I‚Äôm not on a cruise (it‚Äôs true)
But there‚Äôs no doubt about it
I‚Äôve got the isolation blues

Snuggle every night, with my iPhone
52 hours of, Game of Thrones
Cooped up in this house, don‚Äôt know what day it is
All I can say is, thank God I don‚Äôt have kids!
Every morning, I hit the infinite snooze (I do)
There‚Äôs no doubt about it baby
I‚Äôve got the isolation blues

Went out to the store once
Let me make one thing clear (right here)
I have no toilet paper
But I have plenty of beer (oh my dear)

Now day 27, of this quarantine
I‚Äôm feeling frisky, looking lean
Maybe this thing, is not so bad
It could be the best time I‚Äôve ever had
I‚Äôm so excited baby
Now I‚Äôm spreading the news (it‚Äôs true)
There‚Äôs no doubt about it
I love the isolation blues

Are you looking for the best video editing program for beginners?  Look no further than Apple's Final Cut Pro X.  FCPX is such a great program for editors at all skill levels.  Its simple ""drag and drop"" workflow is perfect for those who are just learning to edit, but it has professional capabilities you'll love as your editing skills advance.  

If you start with another basic editing program, over time you'll likely outgrow its capabilities, and you'll need to jump to another software and start learning all over again. Final Cut Pro X also is a one time purchase, as opposed to Adobe's Premier which is billed annually or monthly.

Go inside the Northwest Coast collection with Curator Peter Whiteley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz9OkG_BlRM
 
Explore how the Objects Conservation Lab cares for a variety of unique materials from different cultures in the Museum collection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZuYhwozw9Y

See how the Museum added a modern cultural perspective to the Old New York diorama: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndj59hGuSSY
 
The American Museum of Natural History is updating, restoring, and conserving the historic Northwest Coast Hall, including more than 800 Northwest Coast collections pieces, in consultation with several Pacific Northwest Coast communities. Suquamish elder and master weaver Ed Carriere has traveled to the Museum to offer guidance on caring for woven baskets, and last summer, Associate Conservator Amy Tjiong headed to Washington State to learn about materials and techniques that will help the Museum care for the Northwest Coast baskets in its collections.

#LearnWithMe #Basketry #StayHome #WithMe #NorthwestCoast #Weaving #Anthropology #PacificNorthwest #FiberArts

The Museum gratefully recognizes the Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw Charitable Trust, Lewis Bernard, and the City of New York, whose leadership support has made the restoration of the Northwest Coast Hall possible.
 
Critical support has also been provided by the Selz Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
 
The conservation of painted totem poles has been made possible by the Institute of Museum and Library Services under grant number MA-30-17-0260-17.
 
Additional support has been provided by the Family of Ned Hayes, Bank of America, the Stockman Family Foundation, and the Gilbert & Ildiko Butler Family Foundation.

:RA4PawVVL1Y,How Coronavirus Spreads Person to Person | COVID19 | SARS-CoV-2 | #StayHome #WithMe #StopCOVID,"How COVID-19 Spreads | Person to person spread Corona Virus | SARS-CoV-2 | Stop Child Abuse 
#StayHome #WithMe #StopCOVID #LockdownStrategy #BestPreventionsToSaveYourself #CoronavirusEffectsCountry #Howtostopcoronavirus #Cronavirus2019

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
https://www.nih.org.pk/novel-coranavirus-2019-ncov/

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Can someone spread the virus without being sick? People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).

Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

How easily the virus spreads

How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.

The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (‚Äúcommunity spread‚Äù) in some affected geographic areas.

:RQzVUfYh4qY,Showcasing POC Makeup Looks! | Show Your Support!,"Todays video is Showcasing POC Makeup Looks! | Show Your Support! This video is extra special because it is focused on the members of the beauty community that are routinely left out. POC. So today's video is a tribute to some of the most talented makeup artists that follow me! Let's make a change in the beauty community. Come together. There's no excuse for a lack of diversity and inclusivity. The beauty community should be a place where everyone can come together and share their passion for all forms of makeup artistry. I will always do whatever i can to make EVERYONE feel welcome and included. So I would love for everyone to take a moment and share this video with anyone who falls under the category of POC and let them know that there are people like Cody Jay who appreciate everything about them and their skills and to not feel discouraged. I love you all. I hope you all enjoy today's video and the message I am trying my best to get out. I have posted all of these amazing makeup artists Twitter links down below. Please go check them out and show them some love and support!!

Why do we make How-To Videos for All Abillities?

Our son Knightly couldn‚Äôt cope with much of daily life: hearing clanging dishes, going to the dentist, or walking into movie theaters.  So we began using these videos.  And the world has opened up for him.  
Our How-To videos guide step-by-step what someone can expect, what they need to do, and how to communicate their needs when these are challenges for them to do so.  Research shows video-based modeling is a powerful tool for many types of people, especially people with disabilities such as Down syndrome or autism.  In our How-To videos, we include sign language, subtitles, and an AAC device called LAMP that Knightly uses to communicate.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Travis‚Äô Ginger Chicken and Rice:

5 lbs chicken
2 cups long-grain white rice

Marinade Ingredients:
1 white onion, chopped
1 bunch of cilantro, chopped 
1 cup of soy sauce 
1 cup water
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon minced garlic 
1/2 table to 1 tablespoon freshly minced or grated ginger depending on taste
Salt and pepper to taste, keeping in mind soy sauce had already added some salt to marinade 

Mix marinade and add 5 pounds of chicken thighs or breast if preferred, marinade for at least one hour.

While marinating, cook 2 cups of preferred rice to serve with chicken.

Grill chicken at about 380 degrees, 15 mins per side or until done.

For additional ginger sauce: boil leftover ginger marinade for at least 5 minutes to kill bacteria, boiling longer will create thicker sauce if desired.

:TFtBrPardTA,Perfect JEEP Oil Change Challenge HOW TO #Stayhome #Withme,"I'd like to draw your attention away from the news and into your garage and more importantly... to your Jeep Wrangler for a fun HOW TO Do it Yourself Oil Change Challenge!
Thanks to the Jeep engineers for using the cartridge style oil filter, it is possible to do an oil change and not spill a single drop on the floor... and that's the challenge!  I just happen to go take it to the next level in this video to not only keep almost every drop of oil contained... I only used one paper towel for the whole procedure.  
Here's a link to the AutoEdits Amazon store and I've put together a list called Jeep Wrangler Oil Change Essentials: 
https://www.amazon.com/shop/autoedits
There you'll find everything needed for a home oil change plus both options of the Lucas oil I recommend in the video... go with the six pack of 5w-20 Synthetic to be the perfect factory spec or go with the 0w-20 to quiet down the rattling some of the Pentastar 3.6 engines are known for. 
Just make sure you check the oil filter and that it fits your year and model Jeep... the cartridge might have change throughout the run of JK's.
After we deliver the perfect oil change, I'll take you in the cab and show you how to reset the Oil Change Warning light.
Here's a link to the How to Clean your 4x4 video I also mention in this video and it will show you how I get the engine bay looking so fresh and so clean in this video https://youtu.be/xWmMVSEcq2o

:TODJBQ0tnow,Molly Makes Roast Chicken and Potatoes | From the Test Kitchen | Bon App√©tit,"Cook #withme #stayhome - Join Molly Baz in the Bon App√©tit Test Kitchen as she makes roast chicken and potatoes. This isn‚Äôt the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you‚Äôre probably familiar with. Instead, it‚Äôs a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that‚Äôs more similar to rotisserie chicken‚Äîexcept (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables‚Äîcarrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel‚Äîunder the bird for a built-in side, huh?

:TuOcLuBa1N8,We Got a Trampoline!,"It's the weekend and we are a couple of weeks into this crazy time in the world right now with the coronavirus. The kids are pretty excited today though because Jason is almost done putting together their new trampoline! It took 3 days to build but it will be well worth the wait. The kids also receive some new Lego sets to keep them occupied while under quarantine, but they tend to complete them really quick, so we'll see how that goes! Lucy is also having some anxiety over being stuck inside lately, so she decides to organize our home school room. Life sure is taking its toll lately, but we're keeping a positive outlook on things and trying to focus on the good.

Hey parents! We're now on ROKU. Search for ""Tic Tac Toy"" on your Roku enabled device to download our app. It's a great way to help monitor what your children watch online.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

You guys probably already follow  my yoga channel
https://www.youtube.com/c/RangeofmotionwithAuroraWillows 

Thanks for your support there and I am really humbled to have you follow me here as well.
This is my break away time from being online and from my yoga work so I hope you enjoy my fun space.

I enjoy creating different things, right now I am playing with acrylic pouring but I do other things to.
I enjoy drawing, sewing, doing puzzles, clay work and recycling projects.
Sometimes I try new things as well.

:U28Ya0Fkul0,Develop Patience and Relieve Anxiety with Nature's Lessons / #StayHome and Meditate #WithMe,"Join Sara Raymond for a 20 minute guided mindfulness meditation to help you develop patience and relieve anxiety by considering nature's lessons.

Lao Tzu once said, ‚ÄúNature does not hurry yet everything is accomplished.‚Äù  Just as the way water patiently erodes the surface of a rock, we too can soften overtime when we follow the path of least resistance and let go of our struggles.  We add unnecessary suffering to our experience when we want our reality to be something other than what it really is.  With patience for the process, we can release our resistance, accept what is, and we can experience peace.  

Letting go of resistance and experiencing acceptance is an ongoing practice.  It is one that can be especially difficult, yet extremely useful during challenging and uncertain times.  Slowing down and discovering patience during meditation is like training for our day to day life experiences.  Enjoy the process, be patient, allow yourself to learn and grow, and trust the journey.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

We'll complete the light sketching to follow with a little darker outline to get to the final drawing. This may not always be the final drawing, but this will guide you to your final stage.

Not all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise. Discontinue your exercise session immediately if you experience any pain, dizziness or discomfort. 
Partaking in training sessions following GCN's video instruction is entirely at your own risk, and Global Cycling Network, its partners and its affiliated companies cannot be held responsible for any injuries which may occur as a result of these exercises.

:WvYENLquWDU,All Together IPA Recipe - A Clawhammer #Stayhome and Brew Special,"Bored during quarantine? Already watched Tiger King twice? Tired of the news? Now you can sit back and watch Kyle as he tackles a totally normal brew day on his own. Well, he does have a few friends who help him along the way, but you'll have to see that for yourself. 

We're brewing the All Together IPA (https://alltogether.beer/), which is a refreshing and delicious golden, hoppy beer - but it's the cause behind the beer that makes this one special. This project is a worldwide, open-ended beer collaboration created to raise support for the industry we love. All YouTube revenue made from this video will be donated somewhere and we'll use the comments to guide us. That's right, we're asking YOU, our viewers, to choose what that means. So let us know in the comments where you think the money should go. We hope you enjoy the video, and yes, we are also worried about Kyle. 

Keep your eye out for a special guest (live from prison!), a ghostly floating eyebrow piercing that's not at all an editing mistake, and some important advice from a totally legit doctor!

:XFvVmVwn444,Create A Faerie Terrarium | Amazon Review | Fairy House Lore #WithMe #StayHome,"Come and create one with me Live today as a fun activity while staying at home. It will be a review of a Terrarium kit I bought on Amazon, so let's see if it is good enough for our fairy friends. I will also show you my fairy house I made before!

#WithMe #StayHome

Terrarium kit used:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YSZXBDM?pf_rd_r=7KJMA2Y7SWWFXNDKJQN6&pf_rd_p=ab873d20-a0ca-439b-ac45-cd78f07a84d8

Note that you can use the glass jar it comes in, or you can use your own. Also though activated carbon or charcoal is an important element because it helps remove toxins and odors. If you don't have charcoal, you can still make a terrarium, but you'll need to ensure using lots of live moss to help absorb the odors and keep it clean.

Things will be done a little differently here, we are going to develop as we go but what we would like to do is go back to the good old days were we attack the arguments, not the person.

Now please feel free to get involved in the chat and have a good back and forth, but we will be operating on a simply warning system as follows:

If there are personal attacks or posts that are against terms of service you will receive a timeout as a warning the next will require more harsh actions.

The same standards will be expected from the mods in the chat also, and A SPANNER is no protection.

:XuXKiOzQMNc,Homemade Fresh Butter and Ghee | EASY Makkhan and Desi Ghee #StayHome #WithMe,"Butter makes everything better and homemade butter is truly amazing! It‚Äôs not something I make on regular basis as buying butter is way easier. But somedays I like to whisk a big batch and enjoy it fresh in several different ways. As for Ghee, it is not just a pantry ingredient for Indians, it is also very auspicious to us. We do use it for cooking and baking but also use it during most of our prayers, festivals and pour it in lamps for lighting. So make fresh butter and ghee even if very occasionally. #playfulcooking #freshbutter #ghee #makkhan

DETAILED BLOG POST - https://www.playfulcooking.com/spice-and-condiment/make-fresh-butter-and-ghee/ 

Do keep in mind that the brown solid milk can taste good only if it‚Äôs still toasty brown and not burnt. Here are the different ways you can enjoy it:

Sprinkled on mashed potatoes.
Sprinkled on savory warm porridge
Tastes amazing in the white pasta sauce
On steamed vegetables, omelets or a warm bowl of soup
A delicious fudge called milk cake uses the brown bits. My mother in law makes it and I need to learn it from her.

Not all exercises are suitable for everyone - there is no ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô approach. As with any strenuous exercise, you should take into account factors such as your flexibility, strength and overall health to determine if an exercise is appropriate for you, and consult a doctor/physician before beginning a programme of exercise. Discontinue your exercise session immediately if you experience any pain, dizziness or discomfort. 
Partaking in training sessions following GCN's video instruction is entirely at your own risk, and Global Cycling Network, its partners and its affiliated companies cannot be held responsible for any injuries which may occur as a result of these exercises.

:YmIAtAXOETM,Make Fabric Face Mask at home | DIY Face Mask No Sewing Machine | Easy Face Mask Pattern,"Hello!
I will show how to make a face mask. It is easy and simple. And now it can be very useful to you!
I have made a fabric face mask video tutorial. In this simple face mask sewing video, I have included the detail on how to cut and sew a face mask step by step no sewing machine needed. Using the plate helped me create a simple and quick pattern. You can make a face mask at home from fabric or similar materials.

This mask is made of cloth, and is NOT a medical device. 
But I hope it can help to prevent throat dryness due to coughing and pollen, and as an etiquette to prevent your saliva from splashing by sneezing.
I hope the situation in the world will get better soon!

:ZJTadp-PmO8,#StayHome #WithMe Coronavirus 7-Step-Workplace Safety-,"Coronavirus 
Health & Safety Guide:
How to Protect Yourself And Keep Everyone Around You SAFE too!

What is Coronavirus (COVID-19)?
Coronavirus is a contagious viral strain that can be passed from one person to another, via:
 *Direct contact (within 2m/6ft)
 *Respiratory droplets - sneezing, coughing, talking
 *Touching a surface infected with the virus

But DO NOT FEAR! Coronavirus Prevention Guy is here! 

Follow these 7 simple steps to prevent the spread of the virus and protect you, your family, colleagues, and anyone nearby!

Step 1: HANDS
Wash your hands for at least 60 seconds with soap. If no soap is available use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Step 2: FACE
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as they‚Äôre the most common entry points of the virus.

Step 3: DISINFECT
Clean your work surfaces (desk, conference table, lunch area) using spray or disinfectant wipes.

Step 4: AVOID CONTACT
Wash hands after contact with frequently touched objects, such as doorknobs, light switches, computers, and...
fellow STAFF!

Step 5: SELF CARE
You've got a better shot at fighting the virus if you have a healthy immune system: 
sleep, eat nutritious food, exercise, and reduce stress.

Step 6: TRAVEL
Please avoid all non-essential travel.
Consider alternative ways to communicate, such as video conferencing and virtual collaboration tools. Your company may probably offer Zoom, Slack, and WhatsApp or any other app.
If you need any technical support, consult with your  IT HelpDesk.

And MOST IMPORTANTLY...

Step 7: WORKING FROM HOME
Although it‚Äôs tough to keep a distance from those around you, minimize contact with family/ roommates. 
Social distancing is important for everyone‚Äôs safety. 
If leaving the house, avoid crowds and groups of people (3 or more).

***How do you know if you‚Äôve been infected with Corona? ***
Symptoms range from those of the flu to a mild cold, including:
       *Fever
       *Cough
       *Shortness of breath
       *Breathing difficulties  
If you experience any of these symptoms, DO NOT PANIC. 
Call your local emergency health service
Awareness is the key to prevention. Call 1-800-525-0127 and press # from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week for updates, or if you have any questions!

:Zc4pY6dQNFA,How To Shift on Cello | Day 3 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"üß°Day 3 of Stay at Home Practice Challenge!üëáüèº
Today is all about shifting.  If you are a beginner and haven't learned to shift yet, please think about your left hand position and pay attention to how it feels. If you have exercises that incorporate shifting, then please spend a little more time on it. Also pay attention to how you shift when you are doing your pieces or your concertos. Are you thinking about the note you are shifting to? Are you hearing that note? Does you body know where the note is?

Please show me your shifting practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw. I will also be doing a live video everyday practicing each day's focus on Instagram!

:_57XMcrskqE,#StayHome and Learn Chinese #WithMe | Phrase of the Day Challenge (Week 8/Day 4),"Today you'll learn how to say ""give something a try"" in Chinese. The key word in this phrase, ËØï (sh√¨), is pronounced exactly the same (with the same tone!) as two other super common words in Chinese: ÊòØ (sh√¨) and ‰∫ã (sh√¨). 

Homophones - words that sounds the same but have different meanings - can be a little confusing at first, but they are actually one of the most fun, creative aspects of the Chinese language.

Today is all about vibrato.  If you are a beginner and haven't learned to vibrate yet, please think about your left hand shape and pay attention to how it feels.  Today whatever you may be practicing, I would like you to do conscious vibrato.  Think about which notes need faster, slower, wider, or narrower vibrato.  Are you vibrating every note?  Do you vibrate at the beginning of each note?  Really pay attention to your vibrato today and make sure that you are doing everything consciously rather than subconsciously.

:_sGNotkXMnU,HOW TO COOK  IMMUNE BOOSTER OILESS PEPPER RICE STEW. #stayhome and Cook #withme,"The purpose of this video is to encourage people to eat healthy diets. From the information I got so far. I think strong immune system can help ward off diseases. Eating foods that are rich in Vitamins and Minerals e.t.c will go a long way to cut down the risk of contacting diseases. 
    
     This pepper rice stew is very easy to cook and very much affordable. It is packed with natural ingredients, that are suitable for immune systems efficiencies. 

INGREDIENTS :
RED bell peppers (tatashi) 
Yellow pepper 
Crayfish 
Dry fish
Onions
Ogiri okpei (local seasoning) 
Seasoning cubes
Salt
Scent leaves 
NIGERIAN pumpkin leaves 
Curry leaves 
Dried ginger powder 
White pepper. 

 All peppers are rich in vitamins A, C, and K, but red peppers are simply bursting with them. Antioxidant vitamins A and C help to prevent cell damage, cancer, and diseases related to aging, and they support immune function. They also reduce inflammation like that found in arthritis and asthma.
https://home.howstuffworks.com/peppers3.htm

Pumpkin leaves boosts the immune system
The immune system comprises the organs and processes of the body that provide resistance to infection and toxins. And these organs include the thymus, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
However, owing to the rich content of vitamins and minerals contained in it, pumpkin leaves have been shown to be a high booster of the immune system.
Thus, maintaining an overall health in the process.

About Joe:

Joe Wos has been a professional cartoonist since the age of 14. His career path over the past 30 years has taken as many twists and turns as one of his mazes, as he finds new and innovative ways to pursue his passion for the cartoon arts.

Some highlights include spending 30 years touring nationwide as a performer, illustrating stories live as he told them; founding and running a cartoon art museum in Pittsburgh; illustrating symphony performances live with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; and exhibiting his art in museums worldwide. Joe has also been the visiting resident cartoonist of the Charles M. Schulz Museum for the past 18 years.

With MazeToons ‚Äî a unique hybrid illustration that is part cartoon and part puzzle ‚Äî Joe has fulfilled a lifelong dream to appear in the funny pages. His feature appears in newspapers worldwide.


Joe has been drawing mazes since the age of 7 and is regarded as a master maze maker. In 2012, he created the world‚Äôs largest hand-drawn maze.

The maze garnered international attention with articles in the Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post and media coverage throughout Europe. One of his mural-sized mazes is on permanent display at StarKist‚Äôs international headquarters.

Meh, I finished this earlier in the day so I guess I don't really have that many thoughts to put here. I will say though that regardless of what happened, there is not much reason for me to stay mad, I mean since when has a kid not done something stupid in their life? Chances are it will just be one of those haunting memories. One day he might remember... ""holy crap I actually bit someone."" Everyone has those so its just part of being a person. As long as the proper lesson was learned.

Today is all about playing our scales!  Let's focus on major scales today, but we are going to do things  little differently.  I want us to focus on 2-3 aspects of what we talked about in the past 11 days.  For examples, you can play your scales while trying to focus on your posture, or you can play scales and focus on your vibrato, or even sound production!  You can pick!

I'm Jill, I've been making basket for almost 30 years- welcome to my world of basketry! 

If you love weaving baskets and are looking for some good step-by-step instructional videos then this is the place to hang out.  I use to travel all over the country teaching basketry now I stay in North Idaho and make videos, it works.   

Watch my videos for easy to make and inspirational basketry projects.

My goal is to show you that weaving a basket is not rocket science and veering off into the unknown of designing your own baskets doesn‚Äôt have to be hard, it just takes a few tricks and a little bit of math.

Jesus Christ promises to join with you to bring comfort, healing and a peace that will transcend the understanding of this incomprehensible and enigmatic situation.

Learn 3 truths from a #ChristianPerspective that will bring you #encouragement in this trying time and teach you how to lay a prayer of lament at the foot of the Cross. I'd love it if you shared this video with a friend or loved one that might be struggling, too. Let's put prayer first and see how God will move. Leave me your prayer requests below. I'd truly love to hear from your heart in this season. Maybe you're crushing it and on top of the world-- that's awesome and I join my faith with yours!! Take a minute to pray for someone else as you read over the comments.

:bn56d80KqT0,How To - Quick and Delicious Cheese Sausage Balls Recipe | #stayhome #withme,"Part of the #StayHome #WithMe campaign, Easy to throw together and done in 30 minutes. While cooking isn't common on my channel, this is a music video short that I had fun with.

How I Did it - 3 ingredient Sausage Ball recipe.  
1) Set oven to 350F or 175C
2) Shred 1 lb Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese
3) Add 1 lb Hot sausage (Jimmy Dean, or any brand will do)
4) Mix in 2 cups Bisquick
5) Add cayenne for even more spice if desired

Mix all ingredients together in your Kitchen Aid Mixer using a Flat Head Beater (https://amzn.to/2XY7nxJ) for 5 minutes or mix by hand. Form into approximately 35 balls on an ungreased cookie sheet.

Bake for 25 minutes or until slightly browned on top. Serve hot, refridgerate leftovers.

:d2RvOZFwXAE,How to Tune to Tuner | Day 4 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"Today is Day 4 of our 21 Days Practice Challenge!  Do you use a tuner to practice?  If you don't, it's time to download it on your phone.  There are many apps out there.  Let's say you are playing a D Major scale, tune to D.  If you are playing a piece in D Major, also tune to D.  Listen carefully to the note and see if you can make adjustments to your intonation.  You can also tune to your pieces and concertos, or even just one specific passage where you have intonation issues.  

Show me your practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw.

Classes will take place daily Monday-Friday at 1pm Eastern time.

With the growing concern over the Coronavirus and schools canceling, classes many parents and schools are struggling with how to provide fun educational opportunities for their kids at home.

Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa California for the past 18 years. Joe has been a staple of comic cons, school assemblies and library programs for the past thirty years touring worldwide. 

‚ÄúTeaching cartooning has been my life-long mission,‚Äù Said Joe from his home-based studio in Oakmont, PA. ‚ÄúI realized with so many kids stuck at home they would be missing out on much needed art classes and this was a great opportunity to share my love of the cartoon arts.‚Äù

About Joe:

Joe Wos has been a professional cartoonist since the age of 14. His career path over the past 30 years has taken as many twists and turns as one of his mazes, as he finds new and innovative ways to pursue his passion for the cartoon arts.

Some highlights include spending 30 years touring nationwide as a performer, illustrating stories live as he told them; founding and running a cartoon art museum in Pittsburgh; illustrating symphony performances live with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; and exhibiting his art in museums worldwide. Joe has also been the visiting resident cartoonist of the Charles M. Schulz Museum for the past 18 years.

With MazeToons ‚Äî a unique hybrid illustration that is part cartoon and part puzzle ‚Äî Joe has fulfilled a lifelong dream to appear in the funny pages. His feature appears in newspapers worldwide.


Joe has been drawing mazes since the age of 7 and is regarded as a master maze maker. In 2012, he created the world‚Äôs largest hand-drawn maze. Measuring at 140 square feet, it features more than 100 illustrations. The maze garnered international attention with articles in the Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post and media coverage throughout Europe. One of his mural-sized mazes is on permanent display at StarKist‚Äôs international headquarters.
With great delight, he has heard every variation of the phrase ‚ÄúA-maze-ing.‚Äù","['cartooning', 'cartoon lessons', 'how to draw', 'how to cartoon', 'how to toon', 'drawing lesson', 'learn to draw cartoons', 'learn to draw']",toon request drawinglessons howto draw cartooning cartooncartooning cartoon lesson draw cartoon toon drawing lesson learn draw cartoon learn drawdraw joe teach draw request big bad wolf red panda joe honey badger cat eating ice cream join cartoonist joe wos free live drawing lesson class take place daily monday friday 1pm eastern time growing concern school canceling class many parent school struggling provide fun educational opportunity kid home school offering remote learning art class harder come internationally syndicated cartoonist joe wos mazetoons fame taking marker hand help live class take place howtotoon 1pm eastern time zone monday friday student access visiting howtotoon joe teaching cartooning three decade currently teach daily cartooning class central catholic high school pittsburgh pa also visiting resident cartoonist charles schulz museum santa rosa california past year joe staple comic con school assembly library program past thirty year touring worldwide teaching cartooning life long mission said joe home based studio oakmont pa realized many kid stuck home would missing much needed art class great opportunity love cartoon art session last minute geared toward age using easy instruction joe cover art visual storytelling basic line work creating character student amazed ability student even email joe special request lesson draw animal class free open age signup necessary joe joe wos professional cartoonist since age career path past year taken many twist turn one maze find new innovative way pursue passion cartoon art highlight include spending year touring nationwide performer illustrating story live told founding running cartoon art museum pittsburgh illustrating symphony performance live pittsburgh symphony orchestra exhibiting art museum worldwide joe also visiting resident cartoonist charles schulz museum past year mazetoons unique hybrid illustration part cartoon part puzzle joe fulfilled lifelong dream appear funny page feature appears newspaper worldwide joe drawing maze since age regarded master maze maker created world largest hand drawn maze measuring square foot feature illustration maze garnered international attention article wall street journal huffington post medium coverage throughout europe one mural sized maze permanent display starkist international headquarters great delight heard every variation phrase maze ing,how-to,"['alliance', 'attachment', 'guidance']",3221,[]

:e_FNfS7PY-Q,Cello Practice Ritual | Day 2 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"Today is Day 2 of our 21 Days Practice Challenge.  Today is all about creating a space, and having a ritual that allows you to be focused and to concentrate on your practice.  Everyone's practice ritual is going to be different.  For me it's about having a safe space and a sanctuary where I can have a relationship with the cello.  I want my space to be as sacred and as comfortable as possible.  I also do some meditation and yoga before my practice to get my body and mind aligned.  What is your practice ritual?  If you don't have one, consider creating one.  

Share with me your practice ritual in the comments below or on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw.

Welcome to our dinosaurs for kids channel, where Chase and Cole are the Dinosaur Patrol in their very own Jurassic World.  If you're looking for educational, entertaining, safe and family friendly content then subscribe now and join along for all of our Dinosaur Adventures. We want you to be in the Dino Squad and want to teach you about all different dinosaurs around the world so you can learn how you can become part of the Dinosaur Patrol.

The Dinosaur Patrol will go on Dinosaur rescue missions every week to save the Dinosaurs who are stranded across the country after getting free from Jurassic World. When they are not using their Jurassic Park Power Wheels to save their Dinosaur friends, they do what friends do, go to the movies, to the beach, to the carnival, to the parks and all sorts of fun places. But sometimes even a trip to park can turn into an unexpected adventure!
 
We will be posting NEW videos to our Dinosaur Channel every Friday. And who knows, maybe we will add in a Saturday if our Dinosaur Parks start to fill up.

LYRICS
I‚Äôve got a song on my heart
She keeps me grooving, study grooving 
Got a lover on my mind
She keeps me wanting, study wanting more

If there‚Äôs a fire call the fireman 
If you‚Äôre in pain babe call the doctor 
Don‚Äôt be afraid to say I need you I will understand 

Baby love pretty woman, walking down the way 
If you get tired use your soul power and you‚Äôll find the way 

And if there‚Äôs a fire call the fireman 
If you‚Äôre in pain babe call the doctor 
Don‚Äôt be afraid to say I need youI will understand 
Help me understand

Oh I long for your lovin‚Äô I cant get enough 
When you tell me I can be there when you love again 

When there‚Äôs a fire call the fireman 
When there is a pain babe call the doctor
Don‚Äôt be afraid to say I need you I will understand

Help me understand 

Smooth sailing
When I understand 
Smooth sailing 
On the other side

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

I enjoy drawing, sewing, doing puzzles, clay work and recycling projects.

:gRYhzYS6LlA,EVERY THING ABOUT JOAQUIN PHOENIX (#StayHome and improve your knowledge #WithMe),"American film actor Joaquin Rafael Phoenix, born Joaquin Rafael Bottom has ventured behind the camera, directing music videos as well as producing movies and television shows. Phoenix recorded an album, the soundtrack to ‚ÄúWalk the Line‚Äù. He is also known for his work as a social activist, particularly as an advocate for animal rights. Phoenix's first acting jobs were guest appearances on two television shows with his brother River in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982) and Backwards: The Riddle Of Dyslexia (1984).

:ixQ9ISg4vlU,ANA's charter flight for wounded people & Chief CA's final flight,"#StayHome #WithMe #StayHomeandwatch 
A large fire broke out at a hotel in Shanghai.
The news around Narita is that an emergency charter flight is being organised to fly Japanese who were injured in the fire back to Japan.
Amongst the pilots, there is much discussion about which pilot will be chosen to be the co-pilot on this flight. 

Naito Jane claims he doesn't want to go as he stayed with an ex-wife at the hotel and it would bring back bad memories. 
All the pilots would like to go although Shinkai freely admits he hasn't got a chance.
Then Shinkai is told that the Head of Crew Division wants to see him. 
Until then, he had not even been aware of the existence of such a position. 
The head advises Shinkai that he has been selected by Koda as the co-pilot of the mission.

During the briefing which is run by Koda, they are advised that there are 8 victims being flown back to Japan. 
One is a young woman on her honeymoon who has received severe burns ‚Äì her husband has perished.
Air maintenance mechanic reports that the craft will not be ready until 7:30 am but Koda insists that the first schedule of 7:00 must be met as time is of the essence.
The following morning, the last preparations are made for the chartered flight. 
Several seats are removed and replaced with a cot, and curtains hung to shield it from view. 
The charter flight then leaves Narita, with a crew of doctors, nurses, and relatives of the fire victims. 
Koda has managed to fly to Shanghai in 2 hours and 50 minutes which is apparently quite amazing.

Generally, the flight time takes 3 hours 10 minutes. 
While preparing for the return flight from China, Shinkai ask Koda why he was selected for the flight.
Koda tells him bluntly that previously when he selected an excellent co-pilot, the pilot cracked under the pressure due to nerves and was not able to perform well. 
Shinkai is only an average pilot and therefore would not be so nervous as he had nothing to prove.
He also makes the comment that Shinkai's more average skills as a pilot make it easier for Koda to plan. 
Shinkai is understandably offended by these comments but Koda says bluntly that if he doesn‚Äôt like it, then he'll never select him for another flight as there are plenty of other average co-pilots from which to choose.
The plane is taxiing down the runway, the most critically injured patient suddenly awakens and becomes extremely distraught when she discovers that her husband has perished in the fire. 

Togashi requests time to settle the patient down as it could be dangerous to fly while she is unsettled. 
Koda gives her five minutes. Although Shinkai protests that five minutes isn‚Äôt enough time, Koda says that it will have to be as there are other victims on board.
Togashi tries to comfort the increasingly hysterical burn victim who accuses her of not understanding how she feels if she has never been married. 
Togashi handles this accusation well and explains very calmly and sympathetically that although she has never been married and of course cannot understand how it would feel to lose a husband, she has also experienced the pain of parting from someone she loves very much.
Togashi tells her passionately that she must live to keep the memory of husband alive.

When the patient finally settles down, the plane takes off.
On return to Japan Togashi accompanies the victims to the hospital.
Before Koda leaves the plane, Shinkai wants to know why Koda isn‚Äôt waiting for Togashi to return given that it is her final flight.
Koda says in his way that every flight has different crews and that she will be replaced.
Shinkai protests that nobody can replace Togashi just as no one could replace Captain Koda.
Koda tells him not to waste time assessing others but to reflect on his own performance that day. 
He also orders him not to interfere with what is really Togashi‚Äôs decision to make.

Late that night Togashi returns to the office building to find Shinkai fast asleep in the lobby. 
He asks her not to quit cabin service. 
""Today's flight made me think we need you on flights.""He tells her somewhat awkwardly that he wishes that she would keep flying with them forever.  
She listens to him, says that she needs to take the considerations of the company into account as well as her own wishes. 

The following day, Togashi turns down the promotion.
When she tells Shinkai her news, he is happy and she tells him that she will keep flying until the day Shinkai makes Captain. 
And Togashi whispers Shinkai that she loves him.
Shinkai looks shocked rather than flattered.
Shinkai sits where he is still looking baffled about Togash's words.
When Togashi meets Koda in a hallway and tells him that she looks forward to the fact that she will continue to fly with him. 
Koda looks as happy as a man who is really a cyborg could look, but he tells her that he feels the same way.

HEROES is a tribute dedicated to all of the amazing Heroes during these crazy times.

Whilst on lockdown, Rex and Morgan wanted to do something to say thank you and to show their appreciation to all of the essential workers, so they decided to write a song! 

Thank you to the Nurses, Doctors, NHS, Delivery Drivers, Grocery Store Workers, Postal Workers, Bus Drivers, the Military, Emergency Services and everybody else that has worked selflessly to keep us safe.
Thank you to every one of you that gave us permission to use your photographs/video - you are amazing!
We want to also celebrate all of the incredible nurses for #nationalnursesweek

Retreat (known as Evening Colors in the Navy) is a bugle call played before the flag is lowered at the end of the day. While we think of bugle calls as being solos, several of them actually have multiple parts in harmony from the days when every Army company had a bugler and these field musicians would assemble together and play various calls during the day as a group.

üî∏The Don Sphynx is a mostly hairless cat breed of Russian origin. This breed started in 1987 with the discovery of a hairless cat in the Russian.

‚óº  ‚óº  ‚óº  ‚óº  ‚óº  ‚óº

üî∏Exotic, rare, beautiful, slender‚Ä¶Don Sphynx cats are quite different from other cats. These kittens are so original that they arouse curiosity and fascination. But also,¬†sadly, due to their special physical characteristics(thin, wrinkled and hairless), many people find these kittens¬†ugly¬†or¬†creepy...

üî∏Although these cats seem to be totally bald, they actually have a kind of hair robe on their body, but that is almost imperceptible. Their lack of fur is not due to any disease, nor does it affect their lives.

üî∏These poor kittens are sometimes associated with evil, but the truth is that they are affectionate. Don Sphynx cats are highly sociable, they are very good with families, with children and other pets.

üî∏Don sphynx do not do well when left alone for a long time. They demand lots of attention and interaction, so they‚Äôre not recommended for anyone getting a cat for the first time or for people who aren‚Äôt home for long stretches of time. The cats are very loyal ‚Äî in fact, their loyalty is often compared to that of dogs.

Hi friends!  I'm Jennifer, a forty-something wife and mother of 7 children ages 6 - 22.  We are Catholic.  We homeschool.  We cook from scratch.  We farm cranberries.  We drink coffee.  We advocate for Down syndrome awareness.  We are loud.  We are chaotic.

Here I'll share vlogs about all these things, what I'm doing that works and what I've tried but didn't work.  I hope to encourage you in your journey through motherhood, homeschooling, learning to cook, and growing in your faith through it all.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.

:mu_eTtb_mzE,One Hour Intermediate Full Body Pilates Plus Workout / #StayHome and Workout #WithMe,"Today's Pilates workout with Sara is an intermediate practice.  Incorporate the control and precision of Pilates with some yoga and floor barre exercises added to create a well-rounded, full-body program.  

All you need is a mat and your willingness to move your body to do this workout.  Enjoy and let us know how it feels for you.  Leave a comment if you have any questions. 

Honor what your body needs today.  Be sure to listen to your body and move in a way that feels good and does not cause pain.  Please remember to make any modifications for your body to be safe and feel good.       

Pilates is an exercise method focused on breath, control, and precision using proper alignment.  This type of practice supports healthy posture and can be a powerful tool to help you manage, and in some cases, reverse chronic pain, but it is not a complete substitute for medical care.  This can be paired with meditation as well.  Please consult your doctor if you have pain to assist you with a successful plan.

:nHpSA24IkgQ,Home School Psychology - Compassion (SURPRISE ENDING) #stayhome #withme #togetheralone #mentalhealth,"Lyrics

Call you up, on the phone
Hanging out, if you‚Äôre all alone
Let you borrow my toys
Bring you all kinds of joy
It‚Äôs not to hard to show people that you care

In this video, Mr. Parker celebrates spirit day by wearing college gear so if you have any college gear make sure to put it on. In this video, he discusses the concept of compassion and how important it is when we deal with other people. Compassion is the acting part of empathy. So for instance when we see someone having a bad day, compassion can be talking with that person or maybe giving them a hug. It‚Äôs not about doing something for a reward, instead, it means being kind to everyone we meet. You can show compassion for your family and friends or even someone you don‚Äôt know very well. Mr. Parker tells a story about a kid he knows who donated their toys to sick kids in the hospital and why this shows compassion. The cool thing about compassion is that it helps other people feel good, but we usually feel better after we show compassion. Mr. Parker finishes up with a song to help us understand compassion with some surprise guests. 



Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you! 

Feel free to share these videos with anyone or any organization that might be able to use them, just give credit to Mr. Parker and a link back to this page.

:nOie-Ed2B2Q,Woodturning Scary Cherry,"Wood turning a chunk of cherry, but first I had to take it apart and put it back together my own way.  Incredible looking views along the way, with walls you can see through, and spinning patterns that look hypnotic!  

Special thanks to Mike Gaulitz for sending me this nice little chunk of cherry!  Mike kept the other half of this little log, and you can see what he make with it in this video as well.

The live center accessory that you‚Äôll see in use in this video was made by Mike Benjamin.  He provided this email:  woodturningstuff@yahoo.com  in case you want to inquire about the things he makes, and want one for yourself.

My email can be found on my YouTube page under the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù tab.  That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll need to send photos of your work if you want me to share them with my audience.  Right now, I‚Äôve got about a month and a half waiting list, but I‚Äôll be happy to add you to it.  But‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt without your specific permission to do so, so don‚Äôt forget to let me know, otherwise I‚Äôll just enjoy seeing what you show me!

Thanks to all for watching, and if you enjoyed the project and video, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe and click that notification bell!   Thanks for helping my channel grow!

That clear disk I used is a Center Finder‚Ä¶  you can find it online.

I have an Etsy store called RHumphreyWoodworking   (no spaces) that is not stocked yet this year‚Ä¶ but will be.   I‚Äôm working on setting something else up first, and it has a higher priority.  Thanks for your interest and patience!

I‚Äôm also on Facebook.  It‚Äôs just a regular page‚Ä¶ look for the little carved bald guy wearing bib overalls under my name, Rod Humphrey.    You‚Äôll see things there that I don‚Äôt necessarily show on YouTube, but I‚Äôm not very active there.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.

Be creative in your own space,
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

Welcome to my channel CODY ABROAD! Im Cody from the United States and I absolutely LOVE to travel! After university I worked VERY hard and saved my money. In my free time I was ALWAYS watching travel vloggers on YouTube visit amazing places around the world and I would day dream about doing the same someday. In April 2018 I finally took a BOLD step towards my dream by quitting my job, selling my vehicle and most of my possessions, and moving to China to study martial arts at a buddhist temple for one year and afterwards travel the world and document my adventures on YouTube. I am living my dreams but part of my dream is to become a successful travel vlogger! YOU can easily help me with my dream in just 2 seconds but subscribing and watching my videos. Also please feel free to like, comment, share, and tell your friends about my channel. All of my subscribers and viewers are my friends and I respond to every single comment I receive because I am passionate about my travels and making videos and I love discussing it. Im always here to chat or answer questions about my videos or travel so please feel free to comment. All of these are really encouraging and helps me know that my channel is being enjoyed and motivates me to continue. Thank you so much! Thank you for helping me with my dream!

I've seen enough extreme closet clean out's to finally get off my couch and get rid of some stuff! Seriously, let me know in the comments which items should I keep/toss AND let me know if you want to see my spring wardrobe?!?!?!?

IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GIVE DURING THIS TIME: I work extremely closely with Food on Foot and they give homeless people the tools they need to get off the streets and get jobs. They have a 98% success rate, meaning that once a person goes through the program they will never go back to the street. Unfortunately, a lot of these graduates (who I know, I have worked with, and who have actually been my neighbors) have lost their jobs and are facing a reality where they may lose it all...AGAIN. If you have even just $5 to give, that would help my friend Jay's charity keep people from losing their homes.¬†https://www.classy.org/give/193608/#!...CHECK THESE VIDEOS OUTTIK TOK MADE ME BUY IT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81LLsLG8Sa4¬†TIE DYING EVERYTHING IN MY WARDROBE:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaf2PU27lLQ DYING MY OWN HAIR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oJxS...CUTTING MY OWN HAIR:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdpLh...Trying On Festival Outfits 2020:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvjME...Trying Weird Etsy Food:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2OJ...Trying Emma Chamberlain's New Coffee:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_wvN...LET'S BE FRIENDS ON: TikTok: HeyErinRobinsonINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/erinrobinsonTWITTER: https://twitter.com/erinrobinson SNAPCHAT: @HeyErinRobinson¬†#withme #stayhomesavelives #stayhome #quarantine #closetcleanout #cleanwithme","['try on haul', 'declutter', 'clean with me', 'depop', 'closet declutter', 'try on', 'speed cleaning', 'declutter with me', 'clean with me 2020', 'wardrobe declutter', 'minimalism', 'capsule wardrobe', 'trying on everything in my closet', 'closet organization', 'haul', 'spring haul', 'spring capsule wardrobe', 'try on clothing haul', 'clevver', 'clevverstyle', 'erin robinson', 'beauty break', 'poshmark', 'quarantine', 'closet makeover', 'diy closet makeover', 'marie kondo', 'diy closet', 'organizing my closet', 'konmari']",extreme closest clean getting rid half wardrobetry haul declutter clean depop closet declutter try speed cleaning declutter clean wardrobe declutter minimalism capsule wardrobe trying everything closet closet organization haul spring haul spring capsule wardrobe try clothing haul clevver clevverstyle erin robinson beauty break poshmark closet makeover diy closet makeover marie kondo diy closet organizing closet konmarimany closet seen last month honest seen enough extreme closet clean finally get couch get rid stuff seriously let know comment item keep toss let know want see spring wardrobe looking give time work extremely closely food foot give homeless people tool need get street get job success rate meaning person go program never go back street unfortunately lot graduate know worked actually neighbor lost job facing reality may lose even give would help friend jay charity keep people losing home classy org give check video outtik tok made buy 81llslg8sa4 tie dying everything wardrobe uaf2pu27llq dying hair 3ojxs cutting hair adplh trying festival outfit dvjme trying weird etsy food d2oj trying emma chamberlain new coffee p_wvn let friend tiktok heyerinrobinsoninstagram erinrobinsontwitter erinrobinson snapchat heyerinrobinson stayhomesavelives closetcleanout cleanwithme,homelife,['integration'],603,[]

Lyrics:
(Shut up and act like you‚Äôre having a good time)
[Chorus]Come and meet my Momma
Show her who call up every time I get home
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro
Heart like Arizona
Spicy‚Äôs not my thing but we can make it work
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro

[Verse 1]
Update! I got a new baby
We been doing nothing but feeling so amazing
Haven‚Äôt done the chores in a week
Told her that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm yours.‚Äù so we‚Äôll see how that goes
When she got the floor, no one speaks
You know that‚Äôs difficult for me.

[Chorus]
Come and meet my Momma
Show her who call up every time I get home
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro
Heart like Arizona
Spicy‚Äôs not my thing but we can make it work
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro

[Verse 2]
Been on vacation
Eating my way in
Avocados and bacon
Endless summer vibes
Practicing meditation
And it‚Äôs making me laugh, I get way too impatient
Like I‚Äôm not getting this back
You‚Äôre good at letting go
Of what‚Äôs out of your control, and I think that‚Äôs important
We‚Äôre both emotional, I‚Äôm pretty sure you know this part

[Bridge]
You deserve it all
Whatever that means to ya
Oh yes, baby you‚Äôre gon‚Äô get it
Oh yes, baby don‚Äôt forget it
You deserve it all
Whatever that means to ya
Oh yes, baby you‚Äôre gon‚Äô get it
Oh yes, baby don‚Äôt forget it
Just...

[Chorus]
Come and meet my Momma
Show her who call up every time I get home
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro
Heart like Arizona
Spicy‚Äôs not my thing but we can make it work
Become my koala
Sticking like the part of my jacket that‚Äôs Velcro

[Outro]
You see the brightest star in the room? 
That‚Äôs my baby
You see my smiling hard and wonder why?
That‚Äôs my baby 
Who fills my eyes with super glue?
That‚Äôs my baby
Who‚Äôs got my pride in her front pocket?
That‚Äôs my baby","['#Grady', '#WhoInvitedGrady', '#Gradi', '#Koala', '#Australia', '#StayHome', '#WithMe', '#Quarantine', '#AcousticVideo', '#LiveSessions', '#Indiepop', '#Pop', '#Singer', '#Songwriter', '#LosAngeles', '#FlatteningtheCurve', '#Corona', '#COVID', '#COVID19', '#COVID-19', '#NewMusic', '#JamWithMe', '#BryceVine', '#OmarAppollo', '#CautiousClay', '#Rence', '#UMI', '#PeachTreeRascals', '#RoleModel', '#Clairo', '#CaitlinRusso', '#ZackVillere', '#MacAyres', '#ODIE', '#Whethan', '#EmotionalOranges', '#mxmtoon', '#remiwolf', '#rexorangecounty', '#BabyJake', '#DominicFike', '#BillieEilish']",session grady koala acoustic smilegrady whoinvitedgrady gradi koala australia acousticvideo livesessions indiepop pop singer songwriter losangeles flatteningthecurve newmusic jamwithme brycevine omarappollo cautiousclay rence umi peachtreerascals rolemodel clairo caitlinrusso zackvillere macayres odie whethan emotionaloranges mxmtoon remiwolf rexorangecounty babyjake dominicfike billieeilishlisten new single koala orcd co grady koala orcd co koala apple music orcd co koala applemusic grady whoinvitedgrady grady open artist 6fminntxqjtmomax4kb38r whoinvitedgrady soundcloud soundcloud whoinvitedgrady subscriber button uc9czh9bpmyvsesvvyqfqnsw snapchat whoinvitedgrady lyric shut act like good time chorus come meet momma show call every time get home become koala sticking like part jacket velcro heart like arizona spicy thing make work become koala sticking like part jacket velcro verse update got new baby nothing feeling amazing done chore week told see go got floor one speaks know difficult chorus come meet momma show call every time get home become koala sticking like part jacket velcro heart like arizona spicy thing make work become koala sticking like part jacket velcro verse vacation eating way avocado bacon endless summer vibe practicing meditation making laugh get way impatient like getting back good letting go control think important emotional pretty sure know part bridge deserve whatever mean ya oh yes baby gon get oh yes baby forget deserve whatever mean ya oh yes baby gon get oh yes baby forget chorus come meet momma show call every time get home become koala sticking like part jacket velcro heart like arizona spicy thing make work become koala sticking like part jacket velcro outro see brightest star room baby see smiling hard wonder baby fill eye super glue baby got pride front pocket baby,artistic,['integration'],209,[]

Eric M Eat Like A King

Hi Friends! Eric here. You might know me from my popular series free food eat like a king. Or maybe you have seen my UBER ERIC UBEROO instacart personal shopper series. This is just a little look at my real life and how the world works. Thank you for watching I love you all. Peace. God bless you. Have a good day. Have a happy day! :) #yum 


I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I don't know what caused it. I have had chronic pains for several years. It was probably from working too hard and not taking care of myself. And it only got worse the longer that I tried to ignore it. I have also been diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety, Social Anxiety Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder and many more. Did that help me? Not really I have gone to doctors, chiropractors, physical therapy, psychologists, psychiatrists, and more. I would like to think that every little bit helped, even when they had me on a handful of different prescription medications. If they can't figure out what is wrong with me or the cause, then I at least want to be happy, healthy and have a life worth living. I want to have the same opportunities as everyone else in my country, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. :) #yum  WHO IS WITH ME??

This #stayhome mcdonalds vs taco bell Quarantine mukbang #withme was so fun we had a asmr crunch vs competition. This was a Heart warming Father and son Quarantine mukbang in the car (carbang). Kash had got a mcdonalds happy meal with a trolls toy and dad (A-Train) got a taco bell soft tacos and asmr cinnamon twist. Also we stopped at qt (QuickTrip) to get a slushy for kash for our Quarantine mukbang. Kash was so happy to receive a trolls movie toy in his mcdonalds happy meal. Dad (A-TRAIN) and kash loved the asmr crunch cinnamon twist from taco bell. The Taco bell cinnamon twist were so crunchy that it was like a short asmr clip haha. So hey The Elliott Family Of 7 hopes you enjoy this #stayhome mcdonalds vs taco bell #quarantine mukbang #withme family vlog. Because we sure did enjoy this McDonald's vs taco bell quarantine mukbang stay blessed everyone.

:pL5qKo7PbxQ,EP 5: Chick-fil-A MukbangÔºç REI AMI's A Quarantine Series #StayHome #WithMe,"REI AMI & SUPREME LEADER KYO PRESENTS: A Quarantine Series

This series consists of me talking about random things and doing random things to distract myself from all the craziness going on right now. Just something fun and entertaining for everyone to watch while they stay at home. 

In episode 5, I talk about colonist fever, exes, and stabbing myself at 3 years old while trying to finish an insane amount of Chick-fil-A.

:pPArbIc7rGs,Cello Bow Distribution Technique | Day 11 #StayHome #WithMe Cello Practice Challenge,"üß°Day 11 - Bow Distribution Challenge | Stay at Home Cello Practice Challengeüëáüèº

We don't always have to use the same amount of bow all the time!  You use more or less bow as needed.  Are you consciously aware of how much bow you are using?  What I am teaching in this 21 day challenge is for us to be more aware of the choices we make as a musician, and as a cellist.  The end goal is always about the music.  But in terms of how we get there, we have to make technical choices that are in alignment to the music.  Watch this video to see how, when, and where I choose to distribute my bow.  

Leave me a comment and let me know what comes to mind when you think about bow distribution?  Are you making conscious decisions about where you bow goes?

So many of you have sent us prayer requests and today, we wanted to pray together with you while we are in quarantine.  We are praying for healing, anxiety, depression, loneliness, economic uncertainty, and for our government leaders.

If you are dealing with any of these things, here are some Bible verses that you might find useful.

Philippians 4:6 - Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

James 4:10 - Humble yourselves before the Lord and He will lift you up.

1 Peter 5:7 - Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.

Psalm 34:4 - I sought the Lord, and He answered me;  He delivered me from all my fears.

Matthew 11: 28-30 - Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

Matthew 9:35 - Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.

:qoPAT6CeicE,QUARANTINE Fasting and Workout Routine #stayhome #withme,"Hope you enjoyed my quarantine fasting and workout routine. It's not much, but this is what I've been doing pretty much everyday while in isolation.  The only advice I will give you during this time is to do what you can, whatever that is. We all cope and handle hard circumstances differently, and I am no one to tell you that ""you better not get fat during this time at home."" I am trying and just doing what I can during this time, and honestly that's all we can do. 



I hope you guys are staying safe. See you guys in the next video.

:rC4UMqzqi4E,Tik Tok star Chase Hudson reacts to Sway House diss track that he cheated on Charli D'Amelio!,"Chase Hudson is accused of cheating on Charli D‚ÄôAmelio. 
Jeffree Star is giving us all the tea on his break up with Nate AND the fake car surprise! - https://youtu.be/CiD7asf9mwE

Last we reported on the Hype House and Sway House, they got along. In fact, it was Bryce Hall who said, ‚ÄúThere's no beef with Hype House..."""" A week ago Josh Richards released a diss track featuring Bryce Hall going after Lil Huddy aka Chase Hudson. In the diss track he claims that his girlfriend, Tik Tok star Nessa Barrett, was getting DMs from Chase and they even throw shade at Charli D‚ÄôAmelio. But we didn‚Äôt just get a diss track plus an explanation of the diss track, we also got Chase‚Äôs reaction to the diss track.

My story: I've been making video for a loooong time. I'm a former TV news producer (NBC & Good Morning, America) starting in 1990's. In 2016, I was working hard at creating my own agency as a marketing video content creator when I made the big shift into YouTube and finally answered the call of my 20+ year tarot passion. Talking daily with my guides since I was very young (maybe 5 or 6) .... I finally listened to them. I followed my heart.... My job: to channel information helping others to transform their lives and go in the direction of their dreams. My philosophy: When in doubt, ask yourself ""is what I'm doing loving and loving to self?"" Always choose love over fear.

Let's begin by learning how to draw, I'll be sharing how to sketch. Next, you have the basic shapes in place. We'll complete the light sketching to follow with a little darker outline to get to the final drawing. This may not always be the final drawing, but this will guide you to your final stage. I want you to learn and practice the technique of sketch.  This certainly will help you to become a more skilled artist.

Influenced by Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Al Green, Morton likes to use his music as a way to talk about the issues dividing our country.

Although the New Orleans native primarily listens to R&B and soul music, he's also into rappers like Young Thug and DaBaby. We sat down with the Grammy-winning artist to talk about his current obsessions in the music, film and TV scenes.

Welcome to my channel CODY ABROAD! Im Cody from the United States and I absolutely LOVE to travel! After university I worked VERY hard and saved my money. In my free time I was ALWAYS watching travel vloggers on YouTube visit amazing places around the world and I would day dream about doing the same someday. In April 2018 I finally took a BOLD step towards my dream by quitting my job, selling my vehicle and most of my possessions, and moving to China to study martial arts at a buddhist temple for one year and afterwards travel the world and document my adventures on YouTube. I am living my dreams but part of my dream is to become a successful travel vlogger! YOU can easily help me with my dream in just 2 seconds but subscribing and watching my videos. Also please feel free to like, comment, share, and tell your friends about my channel. All of my subscribers and viewers are my friends and I respond to every single comment I receive because I am passionate about my travels and making videos and I love discussing it. Im always here to chat or answer questions about my videos or travel so please feel free to comment.

The best thing you can do during this time is to keep active, meditate and make awesome changes for yourself during this time.
Think positive, your life will project your thoughts If we all focus on this to be gone it will slowly fade.
If you focus on your body and breathe into the pain and relax the pain will go away.
Stretch daily to see results, go slow breathe deeply imagine yourself in a pain free body.
Now proceed....

Every week I work on a craft project, something fun and creative :)

You guys probably already follow  my yoga channel
https://www.youtube.com/c/RangeofmotionwithAuroraWillows 

Thanks for your support there and I am really humbled to have you follow me here as well.
This is my break away time from being online and from my yoga work so I hope you enjoy my fun space.

I enjoy creating different things, right now I am playing with acrylic pouring but I do other things to.
I enjoy drawing, sewing, doing puzzles, clay work and recycling projects.
Sometimes I try new things as well.

:sbkT6ZmJYW4,Home School Psychology - Intrinsic Motivation #stayhome #withme #alonetogether,"Lyrics 
I‚Äôm searching for things that make me want to grow
There‚Äôs so many things to learn and I want to know
What‚Äôs going to give me the passion to do it on my own
This intrinsically motivating stuff is what I want to know
The passions within me
There‚Äôs nothing that you got to give me 
Intrinsic motivation


In this video, Mr. Parker jumps into the social-emotional idea of intrinsic motivation. This is something that drives us and makes us happy just by doing it; sometimes it can be an activity like doing math problems or reading a book. It‚Äôs usually an activity we do because we love it rather than something we‚Äôre doing because we have to or in order to get a reward. Doing something without a prize will energize us because the reward is accomplishing the activity. Make sure to practice self-talk, because you have the ability to get through it and accomplish great things. Mr. Parker ends with a great song to help us remember that learning is a journey throughout our life.  

Mr. Parker has a wide range of experience including teaching at the university level, working in elementary, middle, and high schools and using music to make social-emotional skills relatable. He‚Äôs been playing the guitar and drums for over 15  years and loves making music. He believes music allows us to relax, have fun, and better remember things we are learning. He‚Äôs found that just listening to music can calm our nerves, help us smile more and better understand our feelings. With over 8 years of experience in schools, universities and private practice, he hopes you‚Äôll enjoy these lessons and looks forward to singing with you! 

Feel free to share these videos with anyone or any organization that might be able to use them, just give credit to Mr. Parker and a link back to this page.

This was an enjoyably creative project! I just adore Lord Baxter and his heritage!! What could be more perfect than placing them on an early 1900s antique mantel. I was thrilled beyond measure to see it had the original mirror intact! I was surprised to see the easy task of painting and distressing this piece. I hope you enjoy this video as much I did creating it. Stay healthy, well, and safe!

I'm working on my normal scheduled uploads as usual, so you'll be seeing new tracks soon! ‡≥≠‡©ß(‚ùõ‚ñø‚ùõ‚úø)‡©≠‡≥®

Lyrics:
I don‚Äôt need drugs
I‚Äôm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can‚Äôt move on
Feels like we‚Äôre frozen in time
I‚Äôm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Love, don‚Äôt you remember
We were the ones
Nothing could ever change and love
It‚Äôs easier not to believe we have broken everything
But here we are
Numb my head till I can‚Äôt think anymore
But I still feel the pain

I don‚Äôt need drugs
I‚Äôm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can‚Äôt move on
Feels like we‚Äôre frozen in time
I‚Äôm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Once this was a garden
This was our world
All of the nightmares stayed in the dark
A little too much time by yourself and you become the enemy
Just look at us now
Drowning slowly just to stay true

I don‚Äôt need drugs
I‚Äôm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can‚Äôt move on

I feel like we‚Äôre frozen in time
I‚Äôm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Will I ever be the same
Am I strong enough to change
Is it in my blood
Shield my eyes to face the day
Come too far to slip away
But it‚Äôs killing me to go on without you

I don‚Äôt need drugs
I‚Äôm wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can‚Äôt move on
like we‚Äôre frozen in time
I‚Äôm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth","['lindsey', 'lindsay', 'violin', 'dubstep', 'electronic', 'sterling', 'stirling', 'amy lee', 'Evanescence', 'string sessions', 'wasted on you', 'stay at home', 'with me', 'live at home', 'cover', 'playlist', 'series']",lindsey stirling string session amy lee evanescencelindsey lindsay violin dubstep electronic sterling stirling amy lee evanescence string session wasted stay home live home cover serieslucky able go tour one idol next guest stringsessions amy lee perform evanescence new song wasted stream wasted evanescence lnk wastedonyouid full string session found ee ls_stringsessions new album artemis found ee ls_artemis head tour date ticket vip upgrade lindseystirling lindseystirllingmusic lindseystirling lindseystirling amy amyleeofficial amyleeev amylee evanescence evanescence evanescence evanescenceofficial sheet music lindseystirlingsheetmusic sign super cool newsletter lindseystirling fanbridge amylee evanescence lindseystirling wastedonyou livefromhome lyric need drug already six foot low wasted waiting miracle move feel like frozen time wasted pas bitter truth love remember one nothing could ever change love easier believe broken everything numb head till think anymore still feel pain need drug already six foot low wasted waiting miracle move feel like frozen time wasted pas bitter truth garden world nightmare stayed dark little much time become enemy look u drowning slowly stay true need drug already six foot low wasted waiting miracle move feel like frozen time wasted pas bitter truth ever strong enough change blood shield eye face day come far slip away killing go without need drug wasted waiting miracle move like frozen time wasted pas bitter truth,artistic,"['integration', 'reassurance']",615,[]

What is a mandala?
Generally speaking a mandala is a geometrical form - a square or a circle - abstract and static, or a vivid image formed of objects and/or beings. In our dreams, the mandala indicates the phenomenon of centering of the ego in relation with the psychic wholeness.(Carl Jung).

LYRICS:
Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

You're lovely don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

üé§ Lyrics: Avicii - The Nights

[Verse 1]
(Hey)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)

[Outro]
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)
My father told me

#CoronavirusUSA #CoronavirusCA #CoronavirusNewsUpdate

 Rebecca Brand checks out Santa Barbara California to see if orders are being followed at the beaches and how Farmer's Market procedures are working for buying fruits and vegetables enforced by the Health Department.  Easter Sunday is here, and the weekend may bring more cases if people break the order.  Currently there are 17 cases in the ICU, 2 deaths, and about 280 cases of Coronavirus verified by a test (lack of tests so it's hard to know the real number of Covid-19).  The only way to understand the spread of the virus in Santa Barbara is through the hospital case count since testing is not readily available.

Now please feel free to get involved in the chat and have a good back and forth, but we will be operating on a simply warning system as follows:

If there are personal attacks or posts that are against terms of service you will receive a timeout as a warning the next will require more harsh actions.

The same standards will be expected from the mods in the chat also, and A SPANNER is no protection.

Also, I'm trying to get some money together for some recent medical needs so, Patreon, Super Chats and PayPal are truly appreciated.

Things will be done a little differently here, we are going to develop as we go but what we would like to do is go back to the good old days were we attack the arguments, not the person.

Now please feel free to get involved in the chat and have a good back and forth, but we will be operating on a simply warning system as follows:

If there are personal attacks or posts that are against terms of service you will receive a timeout as a warning the next will require more harsh actions.

The same standards will be expected from the mods in the chat also, and A SPANNER is no protection.

This will be a platform open to all, and if you would like to get involved with a particular subject please reach out to A MARVEL GIRL using the links below.

:xXYFNmFb6zY,Find Peace of Mind with This Guided Walking Mindfulness Meditation / #StayHome and Meditate #WithMe,"Sometimes, you may not want to be still in meditation.  Perhaps you may want to be outside, connect with nature, breathe in the fresh air, and practice meditation.  Today, I will guide you to practice a walking mindfulness meditation.  You can use this guide as a place to start, then practice on your own if you find value from this type of meditation.  

If possible, practice this meditation outside where there is an ability to walk freely, without concern for physical hazards.  If this is not an option, you can practice indoors, even if you have to continuously circle around the perimeter of a small room, or pace back and forth.  Ideally, adjust the volume so you can hear me, and also still hear the sounds of the space around you.

:xdMTW6q-an8,DIY Food Can Dispenser - with plans #StayHome and build #WithMe,"In this video I build a DIY hanging food can dispenser, which holds 42 cans of food and rotates them. This was a necessary project, since there are a lot of cans of food to store in my house during this quarantine. It helped a lot with organizing my pantry, so I hope it helps you too.

This should give you a fun and useful project to build while you stay home.

:ybbDSyVsV-Q,Easy Fun Improv Cello | Day 19 of #StayHome #WithMe Practice Challenge,"üß°Day 19 of Stay At Home Practice Challengeüëáüèº

As we are nearly the end of our challenge, we are going to have some fun!  And why not?  Who says that practicing has to be boring?  Did you know that you can improvise with just one note and that anyone can do it?  That's right!  Who says that you have to be an expert improviser in order to just have a good time.  So I say start with just one note!  And yes you get to choose which note that is.  Then play around and mess around with the rhythm and see what you come up with.  Once you are comfortable, add another note.  And let's see how many combinations of sound you can come up with!  

Please show me your practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw. I will also be doing a live video everyday practicing each day‚Äôs focus on Instagram!

:ydh08idMVF0,Smoked Turkey Breast | How To Smoke a Whole Bone-In Turkey Breast for Sandwiches,"Today we smoked a whole bone-in turkey breast in our Pit Boss pellet smoker so that we could make some awesome smoked turkey sandwiches. Before the turkey goes in the smoker, it needs some seasoning. We used a simple salt, pepper, and garlic powder and mixed it into some dukes mayonnaise. The mayonnaise on smoked turkey is excellent. It acts as a binder for the seasonings and it also helps you get that nice bite through, crispy turkey skin and also excellent color.
I also injected the turkey with a mixture of turkey broth and Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning to give it some extra spicy flavor.
We set the smoker to 350 degrees so that we could get crispy skin. When you cook at this high of a temperature, you wont get very much smoke so to help us get a lot of smoke on the turkey I filled up a smoker tube with pellets  and let the smoke from the tube work its magic.
The 7 1/2 pound turkey took approx 2.5 hours to cook.

Today we are going to work with the metronome!!  You would be surprised what you find out when you start playing with the metronome - places that you didn't know you had rushed before, and places where you are not playing evenly!  It's definitely very illuminating.  You can also use the metronome to practice slowly and listen carefully.  This can really help us develop a stronger sense of rhythm.

Please show me your practice on Instagram with hashtag #21DayPracticeChallenge and tag me @CellistWendyLaw. I will also be doing a live video everyday at 1pm both here and instagram, and answer any questions you may have.

:yswJU7RFTAw,Best coffee during lockdown (?) - Q&A while trying dalgona coffee #stayhome #withme,"Today for once I will not cook Thai, I will try what seems to be the best coffee during lockdown. Yes, I will be trying the viral coffee, tiktok whipped coffee recipe. Not that I'm a big fan of coffee [SPOILER: I'm NOT], but I needed to find an easy recipe to make while I was doing this 3k special Q&A. I prefer being focused on answering your questions rather than being focused on cooking. That's why I will be making this trending coffee, the dalgona coffee (no mixer version), and once again, I don't pretend it will be the best dalgona recipe, as it's not really the focus of today's video.

Ok, are you ready? Let's go!

ABOUT ME:

I am by no means a Chef, but food and cooking have always been a very important part of my life.  When I was a kid, my parents were owning a street food stall and right after school, I was always running there to help them cook and serve the customers. 

I have also learned a loooot with my granny,  who taught me how to cook traditional Thai food since... well, since forever I believe!

:yurhXS1Jjfs,Weightloss Journey_End of April Update and #Crossrope Review |  #StayHome and #LoseWeight #WithMe,"#Smoon #Smooners #Crossrope #InfinityRopes #WeJump #JumpRopes
Update on my weightloss journey...

Started 13 January, 2020, weighing 250.6lbs, goal weight 130lbs.

Down to 208.2 lbs as of 30 April 2020, down 42.4lbs, 78.2 more lbs to go. 

**So, for some reason, I was not able to download the Live video but feel free to check out: https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMrsS/videos/1379262745604026/

My process:
500 calorie per day diet. 
Not cutting out any food groups, eating any and everything I like just making sure my caloric intake stays at 500 or below; doing this as best I can.
10,000 steps every other day or when it is not cold outside.
Thanks for the concern but my doctor says it's okay, but if she didn't, my body says, ""hell yeah, you better do it!"" 
Tracking my weight loss using an excel spreadsheet I created, weighing myself at 6am every morning.
Intermittent fasting to break plateau lock.
Very light exercise consisting of calisthenics, mostly stretching, Hula Hooping and Crunches.
The #Crossrope jumpropes are an excellent addition to my workout routine, I will download the app for more options!!!

:zVgq5rkNKl8,GYPSY HOUSE WIFE | A DAY IN THE LIFE | SELF QUARANTINE #stayhome #withme,"YALL! Welcome to Another Day In The Life Of A Gypsy House Wife! It's been a while since i posted a ""Day In The Life"" but i figured now is the perfect time! Who else is trying to stay at home as much as possible?! We have went to the store to get the things we need but other than that we have been staying home.. Which honestly isnt too much different than what we normally do. We are kinda home-bodies already soo yeah. In today's video i unbox the March BoxyCharm box, a little cleaning, a grocery haul, and an unboxing of my new Teddy Blake Purse! But anyway i hope yall enjoy this video! I know it wasnt much, but that was because we ended up going live for 7 HOURS!! Which was crazy! I think that's the longest live we have ever done! Next time ill film on a free day, and maybe we'll do something different. This week i also came up with a new recipe i would like to share soon so maybe i can film that also! I hope you are all doing well! Reach out to me if you ever need to! Im always praying for yall! We are going to get through this! Everything happens for a reason you know? Take some time to reflect on some thing's, and take a DEEP BREATHE and BE STILL (psalm 46:10) GOD IS STILL IN CONTROL.

:zXnvYyr3SLE,Talking about COVID-19 in Spanish: Culture & Vocabulary of coronavirus #StayHome #WithMe,"#LearnWithMe Spanish vocabulary and expressions related to coronavirus. Learn about the socio-cultural effects that coronavirus is having in Mexico and other Latin American countries. I will also teach you the most common COVID-19 words used in the media. We will also learn coronavirus symptoms in Spanish, as well as the most common Spanish verbs related to illness. This is the first part of a series of videos. In the next videos you will learn Spanish verbs related to illnesses and how to conjugate them, Spanish vocabulary related to emergency personnel, and the effect that coronavirus has had on our lives. We will also talk about what we are doing and we can do to spend time at home. Learn more Spanish and make your time indoors a little more fun.

I take this opportunity to send you lots of hugs and greetings, in this case safe because we are far away, we are keeping safe distance. I hope you are healthy, and safe.

Lots of love,
Ana

with Chris Nicholson
Read the blog post here: https://npan.co/bgnewy

Are you as good a night photographer as you will ever be?

If your answer is yes, then, as the contemporary clich√© goes, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. As with any art, ‚Äúmastering‚Äù photography is not a goal, but rather a perpetual process. You are never as good as you will someday be‚Äîand that‚Äôs a good thing. Endless are the ways to grow and improve.

That growth happens naturally, as you work past your first 10,000 worst photographs, and then past your next 10,000 worst, and so on. But that growth, as well as the direction of it, can also happen deliberately. You can decide what to work on, and how to do that work. You can set destinations for your talent, and you can choose the roads that get you there.

The new year is the perfect time to do all of that. When the time comes to change the calendar on the wall, I also like to think about how I can better my photography skills in the year ahead. Each January I think about one big thing I‚Äôd like to learn or improve upon, and I keep it in mind on shoots throughout winter, spring, summer and fall, all in an effort to take some control over how I get better.

If you‚Äôd like to take this task on for yourself in 2020, below are six ideas for progressing in night photography. Choose one and focus on it in the year ahead. Then, at the end of this post, I‚Äôll make you an offer.
